# Web-of-Law
This Project focuses on processing legal court decisions and is part of on-going research at New York University. This code is in development and is not ready for public release. We are initially using this github site as a version control and development tool.
We will include several programs under different folders, each folder focussing on 1 or more tasks. Each folder should contain a separate README explaining what is being handled by that code base.
