<quote local_id="2210" start="76847" end="77130" string="&quot; it appears that some abandonment will almost certainly result given the geographical location of the lines of the four roads involved and the companies' desire for efficiency.

<quote local_id="2212" start="77263" end="78217" string="&quot;—a of which portend significant effects on the local communities stretched along the routes of the roads. Deferral of the question of community interests until a subsequent hearing on abandonments will not ensure *537 adequate protection of those interests; for at the subsequent hearing the Penn-Central merger would be a fact, and the pressures would be great for increased economies on the part of the N &amp; W system to make it a more efficient competitor of Penn-Central.
Communities which depend heavily on the railroad industry for employment, such as the City of Scranton, would be affected significantly by any loss of jobs. In its opinion in the N &amp; W Inclusion Case, the Commission noted that in the earlier phase of this proceeding, N &amp; W had entered into agreements with certain labor unions which provided that elimination of jobs resulting from the N &amp; W-Nickel Plate unification would be accomplished only through normal attrition (i. e., &quot;">
<quote local_id="2213" start="78287" end="80014" string="&quot; 330 I. C. C. 780, 822, n. 26); the agreements were apparently modified at a later date to prohibit transfer of employees to other jobs beyond their general locality. For those employees not covered by the agreements, the Commission imposed certain protective conditions prescribed in Southern Ry. Co. 317 I. C. C. 557, as supplemented and clarified in 317 I. C. C. 729 and 320 I. C. C. 377. The Commission concluded that the employees of E-L, D &amp; H, and B &amp; M should be protected in the same manner as their counterparts involved in the N &amp; W-Nickel Plate proceedings. For all employees not covered by attrition agreements, the protection would consist of the following: either N &amp; W's existing agreements had to be modified to cover employees of the included roads or similar new agreements were to be drafted; and, if no agreement was concluded within 60 days, the Commission would impose appropriate conditions. The Commission denied the requests of D &amp; H and B &amp; M to extend this employee protection to their supervisory, professional, and executive personnel.
*538 Whether the use of attrition agreements to eliminate jobs has a substantial adverse impact simply because jobs are eliminated is a question not free of doubt.
The Commission outlined the importance of the service of the three protected roads to the public, but limited this to a showing that, as a geographical matter, the lines of all three roads supplied needed services. 330 I. C. C. 780, 793-794. As far as appears from its decision, the Commission did not consider the unfavorable impact on the communities now served by more than one of the protected roads when the three roads are put into a single system.
Under a heading in its opinion entitled &quot;">
<quote local_id="2214" start="80058" end="80200" string="&quot; the Commission noted that, under N &amp; W control, the three protected roads could achieve substantial savings; and it observed further that:
&quot;">
<quote local_id="2215" start="81180" end="81348" string="&quot; 330 I. C. C. 780, 795.
*539 These general conclusions are not addressed to the objections made by the communities affected. Moreover, the Commission's references to &quot;">
<quote local_id="2216" start="81361" end="81364" string="&quot; &quot;">
<quote local_id="2217" start="81392" end="81401" string="&quot; and a &quot;">
<quote local_id="2218" start="81441" end="81971" string="&quot; suggest that community fears of eventual abandonment or scaling down of facilities are well founded.
The issues tendered by the parties in the Pennsylvania court, touching on the questions just described, are substantial and are not now before this Court for review. They have not been briefed or argued; and I fail to understand how the Court can presume to decide them.
The Court suggests that the community interests involved can obtain adequate protection from possible curtailment of service by asserting their challenges &quot;">
<quote local_id="2219" start="82045" end="86552" string="&quot; Yet it seems clear that postponing review of this question until a subsequent proceeding on proposed abandonments will not protect the communities adequately. The inclusion of the three protected roads into the N &amp; W system surely portends significant curtailment and rerouting of the facilities of one or more of the four roads involved. Once the Penn-Central merger is consummated, N &amp; W and its three included roads will face competitive injury unless their operations are streamlined and economized. The interests of the communities stretched along the routes of E-L, D &amp; H, B &amp; M, and N &amp; W might well weigh less against the threat of Penn-Central competition once the merger has been consummated than those interests would if they were considered and evaluated before actual competition from a merged Penn-Central system is felt.
I do not suggest that we can now decide whether the impact on community interests justifies disapproval by the Commission of the inclusion of the three protected roads into N &amp; W. The question of the adequacy of the Commission's *540 findings on this point has not been presented either to this Court or to the New York District Court; and as pointed out previously, I have grave doubts that the Commission's opinion in the Inclusion Case contains adequate findings on the issue to permit responsible judicial review.
The cases presently pending in Pennsylvania present, inter alia, the question whether the Commission failed to evaluate the adverse impact of the inclusion of the E-L, D &amp; H, and B &amp; M into the N &amp; W system upon the communities served by the carriers involved.
In the action before the New York District Court, here for review in Nos. 778 and 779, that court dismissed the complaints of Shapp and the City of Scranton, with prejudice, for failing to file supplemental complaints attacking the Commission's June 9, 1967, order in the Penn-Central Merger Case. But the complaints of Shapp and Scranton that were dismissed with prejudice dealt only with the merits of the Commission's approval of the Penn-Central merger in its April 1966 decision in Finance Docket No. 21989. They did not attack the Commission's later (June 9, 1967) order in the separately docketed Inclusion proceedings. Thus, there is no question of res judicata present with regard to those parts of Shapp's and Scranton's complaints in the Pennsylvania court which attack the Commission's June 9 order in the Inclusion Case. And, of course, no question of res judicata arises with respect to the complaints of Moosic and Pottsville. Even if the Penn-Central Merger and N &amp; W Inclusion Cases are regarded as inseparable, it is clear that the community impact aspect of the Inclusion Case was not considered by the New York court. It is evident from the record and that court's opinion that the primary concern of the court related to various aspects of the merger and inclusion orders tendered by the railroad parties which were unrelated to at least some of the *541 attacks leveled by the parties in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, including the question of community impact.[6]
The Court seemingly declares, however, a new rule of res judicata in its effort to prevent the parties in Pennsylvania from proceeding with their actions challenging the basic validity of the Commission's inclusion order on the ground, inter alia, that the Commission has not made adequate findings on the issue of the community impact of that order. Because the Borough of Moosic, *542 which had properly filed a suit in the Middle District of Pennsylvania but saw its action stayed, refused to accept the invitation of the New York District Court (a court in which Moosic was never a party, and which neither assumed jurisdiction over Moosic nor attempted to do so by making it an involuntary plaintiff) to come to New York and litigate, the Court holds that Moosic is bound by the decision of the New York court in the Inclusion Case. The New York court itself did not attempt to hold that its orders in the Inclusion Case would bind Moosic if it did not join in the New York proceedings. And I am at a loss to discover any such principle in the law of res judicata.
A party is entitled to its day in court;[7] and I cannot fathom how a party can be deprived of that right or waive it by refusing an invitation—n even an order— to litigate in another court located in another State.[8] The Court could reach its conclusion under the doctrine of res judicata only if Moosic could be termed in &quot;">
<quote local_id="2220" start="86559" end="87409" string="&quot; with one of the parties litigating in the New York action. See, e. g., Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S. 322; Bank of Kentucky v. Kentucky, 207 U. S. 258; Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Tisdale, 91 U. S. 238; In re Howard, 9 Wall. 175. But Scranton and Shapp were the only community interests in the New York court who challenged the Commission's basic finding that the Penn-Central merger was in the public interest; *543 and, as pointed out, their allegations were not directed to the Commission's order in the N &amp; W Inclusion Case. The Borough of Moosic is a separate community, with distinct interests based on the facilities and lines of the various roads located within the Borough, or serving the Borough. Under such conditions, Moosic cannot properly be called in privity with Scranton or Shapp.[9]
The Court states that &quot;">
<quote local_id="2221" start="87510" end="89221" string="&quot; is precluded by its decision. But, *544 as I have already pointed out, the New York court did not pass on at least some of the contentions, including the question of the community impact of the inclusion order, which are raised by the parties in Pennsylvania; nor were those questions even presented to the New York Court for review.
Congress might, of course, channel all complaints against an administrative agency order to a particular court. It has indeed done so in many instances through provisions that a person aggrieved by a certain type of order should seek review in a designated court of appeals. 28 U. S. C. § 2341 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. II). Where review of an agency order is lodged in a court of appeals and review of the same agency order is also sought in other such courts, the court of appeals where review was first sought is the one to which all other courts are directed to transfer all proceedings with respect to the agency order. 28 U. S. C. § 2112 (a) (1964 ed., Supp. II). That has the obvious advantage of centralizing and consolidating judicial review and avoiding conflicts which might obtain if the parties could go to any court that had venue. Congress, however, has made no such provision respecting ICC orders. Section 2112, on which the Court relies, provides in subsection (d) that its provisions are not applicable to review of agency orders in the district courts. ICC orders are reviewable by three-judge district courts. 28 U. S. C. § 1336 (a), § 2325. The general provision for transfer of actions from one district court to another is 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a). But 28 U. S. C. § 1398 provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that actions challenging ICC orders &quot;">
<quote local_id="2222" start="89356" end="89869" string="&quot; And where the jurisdiction of more than one three-judge district court has been invoked and a motion to transfer the proceedings from one to another has been made, the motion *545 is denied if venue would not have been proper for an original action in the district court to which transfer is sought.[10] When a three-judge district court in New York was asked to transfer proceedings challenging an ICC order to the district court in Maryland, where another like challenge was being made, it declined, saying, &quot;">
<quote local_id="2223" start="90010" end="90528" string="&quot; New York Central R. Co. v. United States, 200 F. Supp. 944, 947 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1961). The New York District Court, speaking through Judge Friendly, refused to invoke the procedure provided for in 28 U. S. C. § 2112 (a), since that section applies, as already noted, only to review of agency orders in the courts of appeal. Id., at 949-950. That court was much more faithful to the system of review, which Congress has provided, than we are today. Moosic and Scranton by no stretch of the imagination have their &quot;">
<quote local_id="2224" start="90537" end="92628" string="&quot; in New York. By 28 U. S. C. § 1398 venue plainly lies in Pennsylvania; and Congress has provided no method of transferring those suits to New York.[11]
*546 It is not only hard cases which make bad law. Cases surcharged with the pressure for instant and immediate decision do the same[12] and create precedents which plague us.
It seems clear to me that we must permit the parties to litigate in the Pennsylvania court whether E-L, D &amp; H and B &amp; M should be included in the N &amp; W system. By no stretch of the imagination can it be argued that the question of the adverse impact on the Pennsylvania communities of the inclusion of the three roads in the N &amp; W system, as now posed by the parties in Pennsylvania, was here for review or was before the New York District Court. See Erie-Lackawanna R. Co. v. United States, 279 F. Supp., at 325-326.
Last Term we held that the ultimate fate of the three protected roads must be determined before the Penn-Central merger could be consummated. This surely means that judicial review must first be had at least *547 with respect to the contentions which bear on the basic validity of the inclusion order
The stay order of the Pennsylvania court has expired, and that court is now proceeding with these cases. For purposes of review by this Court, the petitions in Nos. 663, Misc. and 664, Misc., seeking review of the stay order or mandamus to compel the Pennsylvania court to proceed with the cases, can be dismissed. But those petitions did not present to this Court any question concerning the merits of the parties' actions in Pennsylvania; rather they attacked the validity of the order staying their actions in deference to proceedings then being conducted in the New York District Court. And, as already pointed out, at least the question of the community impact of the inclusion order, which is raised in Pennsylvania, has not been presented either to this Court or the New York District Court for review. I therefore dissent from the Court's holding that all of the parties now litigating in Pennsylvania are precluded from challenging &quot;">
<quote local_id="2225" start="92745" end="93318" string="&quot; If the Pennsylvania court believes *548 that the allegations of the plaintiffs are substantial, it should be free to enjoin the merger until questions concerning the basic validity of the inclusion order, at least so far as impact on the Pennsylvania communities is concerned have been resolved.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part in Nos. 778, 779, 830-836.
These cases present at least one serious problem under 49 U. S. C. § 5 (2). Section 5 (2) (a) authorizes two or more carriers to consolidate provided that the Commission finds under subdivision (b) that the &quot;">
<quote local_id="2226" start="93338" end="93345" string="&quot; are &quot;">

<quote local_id="2230" start="93611" end="93940" string="&quot;
I do not think the Commission has made those necessary findings under § 5 (2).

<quote local_id="2232" start="94595" end="94801" string="&quot;)—c await later judicial review. Examples would be the contentions of Reading and the E-L bondholders. But I fail to see how we can affirm the Commission's decision that this entire transaction is in the &quot;">
<quote local_id="2233" start="94816" end="98030" string="&quot; without considering those points raised by the parties which do go to the heart of the controversy. I refer specifically to the contentions of the parties in the Middle District of Pennsylvania (see my partial dissent in Nos. 433, 663, Misc., and 664, Misc.), and to Nos. 830 and 831 which involve claims of the New Haven creditor interests, to which I now turn.
Certain bondholder interests of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company (New Haven) attack the Commission's failure to provide for actual inclusion of the New Haven in the Penn-Central system as a condition simultaneous with, or precedent to, consummation of the merger. Following the filing of these appeals, the Commission, on November 16, 1967, issued a decision concerning the treatment of the New Haven in the merger plan, styling the opinion as a supplemental order in the Penn-Central Merger Case. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. Finance Docket No. 21989, 331 I. C. C. 643. On that date the Commission approved as a first step in the New Haven's reorganization a conveyance of its assets to Penn-Central; it fixed terms for interim financing on the basis of a $25,000,000 loan commitment from Penn-Central; and it provided for the sharing of New Haven's operating losses by Penn-Central, on a sliding scale, pending New Haven's inclusion in the merged system. The Commission also specifically provided that consummation of the merger would constitute irrevocable assent by Penn-Central to enter into the interim financing arrangement.
The sale agreement proposed by the New Haven trustees provided for New Haven's physical assets and investments to be purchased by Penn-Central free and *550 clear of liens and other encumbrances. The lien of the New Haven creditors' interests would shift from New Haven's present assets to the assets held by the trustees as the proceeds of the sale. Provision for the preservation of priorities and rights of claimants was made in the plan. The trustees originally submitted, pursuant to § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act,[1] a plan of reorganization to be accomplished in two steps. Initially, only the first step, providing for the sale of the New Haven to the merged Penn-Central system, was presented to the Commission for approval. After that part of the plan had been completed, the trustees intended to implement the second step, relating to distributing the assets of the New Haven estate or issuing new New Haven securities.
Certain bondholder interests contested the legality of the two-step plan. But in a decision rendered in May 1967 the Court of Appeals held that a decision on the legality of such a plan would be premature. In the Matter of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co., 378 F.2d 635 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1967). In September 1967 the New Haven trustees filed the second part of their plan, but requested the Commission to make immediate findings required under § 5 (2) (d) of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to the first part of the plan, rather than await completion of the reorganization proceedings. Creditor interests opposed this request by arguing that creditor claims, in the order of priority, would have to be considered by the Commission before it could arrive at &quot;">
<quote local_id="2234" start="98045" end="98347" string="&quot; within the meaning of § 5 (2) (d). The Commission chose to adopt the procedure suggested by the trustees, and approved the plan for the sale of assets independently of a complete reorganization plan.
In short, the Commission concluded that an immediate decision on the question under § 5 (2) (d) of &quot;">
<quote local_id="2235" start="98367" end="98407" string="&quot; for the sale of assets would satisfy &quot;">
<quote local_id="2236" start="98501" end="98725" string="&quot;[2] On the other hand, it said, delay of such a decision until completion of New Haven's reorganization would prevent a timely rescue of the New Haven as an operating common carrier. Thus, the Commission opted in favor of &quot;">
<quote local_id="2237" start="98899" end="99548" string="&quot;[3]
The bondholder interests before this Court contend that under either the majority or dissenting opinions in St. Joe Paper Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 347 U.S. 298, any sale of the New Haven to the merged Penn-Central system would require at least its submission to a vote of bondholders. See also Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western R. Co., 328 U. S. 495. The bondholders also argue that the Commission ignored the admonition of this Court in Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U.S. 79, 88, that the powers of the Commission and courts under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act can properly be exercised only in the context of &quot;">
<quote local_id="2238" start="99604" end="100046" string="&quot;
In justifying its action, the Commission noted that except for subsections (b) (1), (4), and (5), of § 77, there is no provision in § 77 that deals specifically with the form or content of a reorganization plan. Therefore, no language of § 77 was believed to prohibit evaluation of the New Haven properties and the approval of their sale before approval of a plan for restructuring the New Haven. The Commission noted the doctrine *552 of &quot;">
<quote local_id="2239" start="100060" end="100289" string="&quot; employed under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act to permit two-step plans of reorganization, and analogized that doctrine to the instant case— since in the view of the Commission, the New Haven could properly be classified as a &quot;">
<quote local_id="2240" start="100303" end="102388" string="&quot;[4]
With respect to interim financing of the New Haven, the Commission approved a loan proposal under which Penn-Central would make available to the New Haven a total of $25,000,000 over three years to enable the New Haven to continue its operations until its assets were conveyed to Penn-Central. The Commission noted that the loan authorization did not impair the jurisdiction of the reorganization court since that court would still have to approve issuance of trustees' certificates to evidence those advances.[5]
The loan provisions approved by the Commission provided further that any time the cash balance of the New Haven fell below $5,000,000, the trustees could borrow *553 from the $25,000,000 commitment enough money to equal a $5,000,000 cash balance plus $2,500,000. The Commission set an interval of at least three months between loan takedowns, and provided that any reduction in the aid which New Haven was receiving from the New England States would reduce correspondingly the amount that could be borrowed from Penn-Central. The interest rate on the loans was declared to be the prime rate of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York City prevailing at the time the loan is taken down. December 13, 1971, was designated as the maturity date for the trustees' certificates. Finally, the loan provisions would be terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) acquisition of the New Haven by Penn-Central; (2) a final and effective order by a regulatory authority or court granting permission to liquidate the New Haven or to dispose of it to someone other than Penn-Central; (3) cessation of the New Haven operation as a going railroad; (4) a determination that Penn-Central shall not acquire the New Haven; (5) the expiration of three years from the date of the Penn-Central merger.
Although the New Haven creditors argued before the Commission that their interests would be reduced by the issuance of the trustees' certificates, which would acquire precedence over their claims against the New Haven estate, the Commission reasoned that:
&quot;">
<quote local_id="2241" start="102911" end="104644" string="&quot;[6]
The Commission did not place all of New Haven's operating losses on Penn-Central during the period of the loan agreement. The amount to be absorbed by Penn-Central is governed by a specific formula approved by the Commission.[7] With respect to deciding how much of the loss was to be assumed by Penn-Central under the formula, the Commission noted two main factors: (1) the admonition of the reorganization court that safeguards against endless litigation by New Haven creditors should be established; and (2) in the interim period before conveyance of New Haven's assets to Penn-Central, the opportunities to integrate New Haven's operations into the Penn-Central system would be restricted, so that many operating economies and efficiencies could not be realized until complete inclusion of the New Haven. The Commission felt that the existence of these factors tended to limit the portion of New Haven losses which Penn-Central should have to absorb under the formula. The final amount decided upon was 100% of the loss during the first year, 50% during the second, and 25% during the third. Further, the Commission set $5,500,000 as the maximum Penn-Central share of operating losses in any one year.
Finally, the Commission provided that under the purchase agreement, the trustees' certificates evidencing the loans were to be offset in an amount equal to the operating loss absorbed by Penn-Central. The Commission asserted that the burdens on the New Haven creditors caused by the loan-loss absorption agreement would be relatively small—a not significantly different from the *555 burdens under a lease agreement. The Commission expected that the total amount loaned by Penn-Central over three years would probably be &quot;">
<quote local_id="2242" start="104680" end="107529" string="&quot;[8] It noted that the requirements for loans would increase in relation to the operating losses of the New Haven; but as the operating losses increased, Penn-Central would absorb a part of the increase. At the same time, the Commission pointed out that since the amount of losses to be assumed by Penn-Central would decline each year (from 100% to 50% to 25%), the creditors would have much to gain by speedily completing the reorganization proceedings.
The bondholder interests attack the operating loss provisions of the Commission's order—c that Penn-Central should be required to absorb all the operating losses of the New Haven. They also assert that the purchase price approved by the Commission for the sale of New Haven assets to Penn-Central ($125,000,000, being the value of the consideration to be received by the New Haven) is too low. Further, as indicated above, they contend that the Commission is without authority to adopt a two-step reorganization plan which prevents the bondholders from voting on the first aspect of the plan—t sale of assets.
The New Haven trustees argue that the bondholders will have the opportunity to object to these actions of the Commission in the reorganization court and to seek judicial review of its action. Indeed, Oscar Gruss &amp; Son (appellant in No. 830) and the Bondholders' Committee (appellant in No. 831) have indicated that they intend to seek judicial review of the November 16 order. The trustees also suggest that the questions presented involve only the quantum of consideration to be paid by Penn-Central in implementation of its eventual *556 take-over of the New Haven, and do not merit postponing consummation of the Penn-Central merger.
On the other hand, the bondholders contend that their objections to the Commission's November 16 order are so substantial that even if they have only partial success on judicial review, the feasibility of inclusion would be open to serious question. If inclusion of the New Haven in the Penn-Central system could not be accomplished, a major underpinning in the Commission's finding that the merger was in the public interest would be removed.[9] The New Haven might then have to be liquidated in the reorganization court. Perhaps eventual operation by the Federal Government, or by the States concerned, would be the outcome. In fact, appellant in No. 831 has pending before the reorganization court a petition for immediate liquidation of the New Haven. The bondholders, of course, seek to recover as much of their investment as possible. To the extent that any loans from Penn-Central to the New Haven would not be offset by Penn-Central's obligation to absorb a portion of the New Haven operating losses, the bondholders' equity would be diluted.
The Commission is commanded by § 5 (2) (d) of the Act to authorize inclusion of a road only on &quot;">
<quote local_id="2243" start="107545" end="107611" string="&quot;[10] Are the operating loss provisions, as they *557 now stand, &quot;">
<quote local_id="2244" start="107626" end="108312" string="&quot;? The provisions may well constitute a prelude to the slow bleeding or squeezing out of creditor interests, as their equity is diminished by loans.
High finance has a great inventive genius; and one does not have to be sophisticated to see how Penn-Central with the use of this loan device can pick up New Haven for a song.
The Commission has itself stated that the Penn-Central merger would not be in the public interest without the complete inclusion of the New Haven.[11] Clearly we should not approve this merger and decide that the mandate of § 5 (2) (b) has been fulfilled without at the same time concluding that the loan agreement and the sharing of the New Haven deficit are &quot;">
<quote local_id="2245" start="108322" end="110110" string="&quot;
On its face the requirement that Penn-Central share the operating losses of the New Haven on a decreasing scale each year—f 100% to 50% to 25%—s inequitable. Why a XXX-XX-XX formula? Why not 100-10-1 or 50-25-10 or XX-XX-XXX? The Commission does not clearly indicate how it arrived at its XXX-XX-XX formula. Of the two factors mentioned by it in making its determination (preventing endless litigation by New Haven creditors, and the inability to realize many economies during the interim period before the sale of New Haven's assets to Penn-Central), only the first would appear to have any relation to the adoption of a sliding-scale formula.
On its face this formula for sharing of losses seems inherently coercive. It would indeed appear that the *558 Commission sought to force the creditors to accede to its proposal within a year. The pressure would indeed be great; for once the merger between Penn and Central is consummated, the New Haven creditors would have to absorb the losses of the New Haven at an increasing rate if they did not accept the Commission's proposal.
If that is the purpose and effect of this provision concerning Penn-Central's sharing of the operating losses of the New Haven, the issue may well have spent itself, unless we grant judicial review prior to the consummation of the merger. Of course, if the merger is approved, one way in which the coercive effect of this provision of the plan could be eliminated would be to undo the merger. But that gets back to the problem of unscrambling mergers of this kind and intricacy, once they are consummated —t difficulty emphasized by Mr. Justice Clark when the case was here before. 386 U.S. 372, 392.
The Court, while not presuming to approve the November 16, 1967, order of the Commission as prescribing &quot;">
<quote local_id="2246" start="110125" end="110433" string="&quot; for inclusion, takes the position that the Commission has done all that is required at this point with respect to the inclusion of the New Haven. But I am unable to reconcile this position with the requirements of the statute, which directs in § 5 (2) (d) that a road may be included in another only upon &quot;">
<quote local_id="2247" start="110449" end="110745" string="&quot;
The coercive nature of the operating loss provision may well frustrate effective judicial review once the Penn-Central merger is a fact.
On the other hand, if the creditor interests do challenge the Commission's order in the courts, and are successful, inclusion in the Penn-Central system on &quot;">
<quote local_id="2248" start="110760" end="111537" string="&quot; at the time of that decision might well be impossible. The Commission itself seemed to recognize the possibility that the New Haven might not be included *559 in the Penn-Central system in its November 16 report,[12] although it evidently believed that the possibility of noninclusion did not justify delaying consummation of the Penn-Central merger. Such an approach is not permissible under the statutory scheme, when the Commission has stated that the Penn-Central merger would not be in the public interest unless the New Haven were included in that merged system. And, as the bondholders have noted, there exists a substantial doubt whether the inclusion of the New Haven on equitable terms as required by § 5 (2) (d) has been provided.
Is such a coercive provision an &quot;">
<quote local_id="2249" start="111546" end="111592" string="&quot; term within the meaning of § 5 (2) (d)? Is &quot;">
<quote local_id="2250" start="111601" end="111634" string="&quot; to be taken to mean what is a &quot;">
<quote local_id="2251" start="111638" end="112045" string="&quot; distribution of losses, risks, and burdens between the old creditor interests and the acquiring company? These are old and perennial problems in the reorganization and merger field. They involve a delicate weighing of legal rights and practical realities. How we can approve the merger under the statutory system without determining whether the loan provision and the provision for sharing of losses are &quot;">
<quote local_id="2252" start="112054" end="113517" string="&quot; remains a mystery.

[2]  See Memorandum Order of the District Court, issued July 3, 1967. Circuit Judge Friendly, for the District Court, noted that &quot;">
<quote local_id="2253" start="113660" end="115936" string="&quot; We agree that this is commendable. If review of the inclusion decision and of the merger decision were in different courts, the difficulties presented by these cases would be multiplied.
[3]  The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) asked and was granted a dispensation from the District Court's schedule for briefs and argument. The CNJ has reserved the right to assert that the Commission's order should contain certain protective conditions for it. It has waived the right to argue that the Penn-Central merger should be delayed. The complaint of the CNJ was not dismissed with the others and the Southern District of New York has yet to consider the position of this line.
[4]  The process of the New York court ran throughout the Nation. 28 U. S. C. § 2321. In addition, the United States waived possible objections on venue grounds to appearances by any party in the New York litigation. In these circumstances, it would be senseless to permit parties seeking to challenge the merger and the inclusion orders to bring numerous suits in many different district courts. See, for the provision governing review of orders of administrative agencies in the courts of appeals, 28 U. S. C. § 2112.
[5]  The formula is directed to compensation for an approximation of the revenues which may be lost by the protected lines to Penn-Central. Revenue ratios are determined by dividing the combined 1965 freight revenues of Penn and Central into the 1965 freight revenues of each of the protected lines. For any given subsequent year, the total freight revenue of the merged Penn-Central and of the protected line in question is then multiplied by that line's revenue ratio. The actual earned freight revenue of the protected line for the given year is then subtracted from the figure obtained by this multiplication. If the result is a positive figure, it is multiplied by an indemnification ratio of 50%, which yields the total amount of indemnity owed. The Commission has indicated that the indemnity conditions are to supplement the traffic conditions, not to replace them; Penn-Central is not given a choice of obeying the traffic conditions or paying liquidated damages, in the form of indemnity.
[6]  E-L and D &amp; H unsuccessfully sought from the Commission a provision for &quot;">
<quote local_id="2254" start="115964" end="116513" string="&quot; to be paid them by Penn-Central in the event that the price for their inclusion in N &amp; W was reduced because of the effect of the Penn-Central merger on their traffic. Although E-L and D &amp; H have presented an appeal (No. 832) on this issue to this Court, the appeal is contingent on our reversal of the Commission's inclusion terms or our upsetting of the protective conditions. Because we today make neither of these decisions, the appeal of E-L and D &amp; H is dismissed.
[7]  In establishing the protective conditions, the Commission has ordered &quot;">
<quote local_id="2255" start="116906" end="116936" string="&quot; See n. 11, infra.
[8]  The &quot;">
<quote local_id="2256" start="116952" end="117081" string="&quot; during which the conditions are to be in effect will run from the date of consummation of the merger until the date of actual &quot;">
<quote local_id="2257" start="117785" end="118612" string="&quot; 330 I. C. C., at 362.
[9]  N &amp; W places emphasis on a letter written to stockholders by the President of D &amp; H, who is a director and a large stockholder, to the effect that he is formulating an alternative proposal to inclusion in the N &amp; W. But at oral argument counsel for D &amp; H reiterated that road's desire that this Court affirm the inclusion order and the merger judgment, and there is no basis in the record before us for concluding that the D &amp; H Board of Directors has changed its position.
[10]  The remaining arguments by appellants in No. 778 may be briefly noted and answered. There is no substance to appellants' contention that the Commission failed to find that the consummation of the merger under the protective conditions would be in the public interest. As the District Court concluded, this finding is &quot;">
<quote local_id="2258" start="119109" end="119360" string="&quot; 279 F. Supp., at 329. And appellants' attack upon the District Court's opinion on the basis of SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194 (1947), totally misconceives the limited office of that decision. See n. 14, infra.
[11]  Section 5 (9) provides that &quot;">
<quote local_id="2259" start="119569" end="120233" string="&quot;
[12]  N &amp; W contends that, for this reason, the Commission should have considered alternatives to inclusion as possible means of saving the service of the protected lines. We believe N &amp; W is considerably embarrassed, in making these arguments, by the fact that the Commission has contemplated inclusion of the protected lines in N &amp; W ever since 1964, when N &amp; W was permitted to consummate its highly successful merger with the Nickel Plate, and when N &amp; W consented in principle to the inclusion of the three roads in N &amp; W. The protected lines were scarcely faring better in 1964 than they are now. Despite the Commission's recognition that these lines are &quot;">
<quote local_id="2260" start="120238" end="121037" string="&quot; it has found their inclusion in N &amp; W to be in the public interest.
[13]  There is no substance to N &amp; W's argument that the Commission failed to consider the possibility that one or more of the protected lines would not join N &amp; W. The Commission plainly did consider this possibility. It was not required to set a scale of terms for inclusion depending on the various hypothetical consequences of its order.
[14]  We reject N &amp; W's argument that the District Court was guilty of a violation of the rule of SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194 (1947). N &amp; W attempts to extend the principle of that case far beyond its limits. But even if we were to accept N &amp; W's construction of the case, N &amp; W's conclusion would not follow. N &amp; W relies on a statement by the District Court to the effect that &quot;">
<quote local_id="2261" start="121254" end="124920" string="&quot; 279 F. Supp., at 355. But that statement does not indicate that the court was basing its affirmance of the Commission on grounds other than those relied on by the Commission itself. On the contrary, the District Court appears to have agreed in substance with all the major findings of the Commission. To the Commission's analysis it added several points that it believed would also support the Commission's conclusions. The ultimate terms for inclusion were, of necessity, approximations based on the probable value of the protected lines to N &amp; W. The District Court found that these values had been properly computed but that, even if they were not, N &amp; W was protected by several adjustments that had been made by the Commission in order to ensure that inclusion was fair to N &amp; W.
[1]  The Borough of Moosic was a party to the N &amp; W Inclusion Case before the Commission, in which it offered testimony and submitted exceptions. It was not, however, a party before the Commission in the Penn-Central Merger Case, reviewed by this Court last Term. Moosic, however, seeks to challenge the merger order in the Pennsylvania action. Since Moosic is served only by E-L and D &amp; H, the Borough notes that it became concerned with the proposed Penn-Central merger only after it learned that the merger was in part responsible for the petitions of E-L and D &amp; H for inclusion into N &amp; W.
[2]  The City of Scranton and Milton J. Shapp were parties to both proceedings before the Commission, and were intervenors in the previous action commenced in the Southern District of New York, which was reviewed by this Court last Term. They were the only parties before the New York court last Term that challenged the basic validity of the Penn-Central merger. (See Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States, 386 U.S. 372, 462 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FORTAS).) Their original complaint in the New York court was dismissed with prejudice by that court on October 19, 1967, pursuant to Rule 41 (b), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., for failure to file a supplemental complaint attacking the Commission's order of June 9, 1967, in the Penn-Central Merger Case. Scranton and Shapp were never parties to the N &amp; W Inclusion Case in the New York court.

Milton J. Shapp is a stockholder of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and a citizen of Pennsylvania. The City of Scranton is served by E-L, D &amp; H and the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The city's interest stems both from the fact that the Penn-Central merger has necessitated the inclusion of E-L and D &amp; H into N &amp; W, thus making Scranton a two-railroad town, and from its fears that the proposed N &amp; W-C &amp; O merger will be approved along with the inclusion of CNJ therein, which would reduce Scranton to a one-railroad town. Since Scranton is a part of the Scranton-Wilkes Barre industrial and distribution complex of northeastern Pennsylvania, it also has an interest in the other railroads serving that economic area—t Reading Company, Lehigh Valley, and the Pennsylvania Railroad, together with their switching lines. The city and its surrounding area constitute one of the most important centers of railroad activity in the Eastern District.
[3]  City of Pottsville was a party to the Commission proceedings involving the Penn-Central merger. The city is a municipal corporation located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, and is served by the Reading Company and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
[4]  Pottsville (No. 433) seeks review of the order of the Pennsylvania court denying its application for intervention in the Moosic case on the ground that the city was not located in the Middle District of Pennsylvania and &quot;">
<quote local_id="2262" start="125063" end="125926" string="&quot; The Government, however, has no objection to the intervention of Pottsville below, and concedes that the court was in error in assuming that the Government's desire to have all actions challenging the Commission's orders brought in the New York court constituted an objection to Pottsville's formally becoming a party in the Moosic case. I therefore concur with the Court and agree to vacate the order denying Pottsville's application for leave to intervene and to remand to the District Court where Pottsville may renew its application.
[5]  This brusque treatment of the community allegations contrasts sharply with the lengthy discussion of certain community interest aspects of the Penn-Central merger found in the Recommended Report in Finance Docket No. 21989, at 229-286.
[6]  With respect to the N &amp; W Inclusion action, the court below noted that only &quot;">
<quote local_id="2263" start="126009" end="127996" string="&quot; Those points were: first, N &amp; W's complaint that the Commission should have considered the desirability of including the three protected roads along with the Reading Co. and the Central of New Jersey as wholly owned subsidiaries, not in the N &amp; W system, but in the proposed N &amp; W-B &amp; O-C &amp; O system; and second, N &amp; W's assertion that the Commission erred in failing to find that inclusion of any of the three protected roads in the Penn-Central system rather than the N &amp; W system would not be in the public interest. N &amp; W has pursued the latter argument in this Court, asserting that by failing to make the suggested finding the Commission has left open the possibility that one or more of the three protected roads can eventually obtain inclusion in the merged Penn-Central system if inclusion in the N &amp; W system is not voted by shareholders. The court rejected both of these contentions, holding that the Commission was not required to inject the N &amp; W-B &amp; O-C &amp; O proposal into the instant proceeding or to make the negative finding requested by N &amp; W to preclude the possibility of eventual inclusion of one or more of the three roads in the Penn-Central system. The court directed the remainder of its opinion dealing with the N &amp; W Inclusion Case to examining the financial terms of the inclusion order, the employee protective conditions imposed by the Commission, the Commission's general standard for, and method of, valuation, certain attacks by E-L, D &amp; H and B &amp; M on matters of valuation peculiar to each road, and the possibility of non-inclusion of D &amp; H and/or B &amp; M in the N &amp; W system—n of which involved the community impact problem.

[8]  Moosic states in its petition (No. 663, Misc.) that it did not wish to litigate in New York because that court had decided to treat the Penn-Central Merger Case and the N &amp; W Inclusion Case as &quot;">
<quote local_id="2264" start="128046" end="128093" string="&quot; and such an approach would prejudice Moosic &quot;">

<quote local_id="2268" start="128969" end="129075" string="&quot; This Court in the instant case makes no inquiry, however, whether Moosic can be termed a member of the &quot;">
<quote local_id="2269" start="129085" end="129167" string="&quot; as one or more of the parties in the New York court; or whether the issues are &quot;">

The Court does not appear to argue that the action in the New York court was a &quot;">
<quote local_id="2272" start="129377" end="129939" string="&quot; within Rule 23, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. Indeed, the court below did not treat it as such, nor make the findings (Rule 23 (a) and (b)) or give the type of notice (Rule 23 (c)) required by that Rule for class actions.
I can find no authority for a rule which would require a party not under the jurisdiction of the inviting court to respond affirmatively to an invitation to intervene or else be bound by an adverse decision. Indeed, Chase National Bank v. Norwalk, 291 U.S. 431, would suggest that the rule is to the contrary. The Court stated in that case that &quot;">

[10]  Our decisions in Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335, and Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, indicate that § 1404 (a) permits transfer only to a district court in which the plaintiff would have been entitled, without regard to consent by the defendant, to bring his action originally. Moosic and Scranton could not have brought an original action in New York.
[11]  If statutory provisions provide that a person aggrieved must litigate his contentions in a specific federal court, fair notice has been given that if he does not appear and present his claims in the designated court, he will forfeit his right to be heard. But when there is no such statutory provision and when indeed the applicable statute provides for review in the Pennsylvania District Court, the place of residence, is due process satisfied when an aggrieved person, who was never a party in the New York court or in privity with any party there, is deprived of a right to be heard on an issue not litigated in that court, simply because he was invited to participate and the United States waived objections? That, I submit, is not a wholly frivolous question.

Nationwide service of process was available to the New York court. 28 U. S. C. § 2321. The United States and the ICC had waived all objections to venue against any party seeking to litigate in New York. But although the United States and the Commission moved successfully in the New York court under Rule 19, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., to join N &amp; W as an involuntary plaintiff in D &amp; H's action challenging the inclusion order, they made no effort to join Moosic pursuant to that Rule.

[5]  By an order dated December 19, 1967, the reorganization court (D. C. Conn.) authorized the New Haven Trustees to issue up to $25,000,000 in trustees' certificates to evidence any loans from Penn-Central obtained pursuant to the Commission's November 16, 1967 order. The court ordered that each certificate issued was to constitute an expense of administration equal in priority to other expenses of administration; and that the proceeds derived by the Trustees from the issuance of the certificates could be expended by them for purposes deemed necessary within their discretion (including current maintenance and operation expenses), subject to the supervision of the court. The court provided that the Trustees would not be required to seek any further authorization to make borrowings under the Penn-Central loan agreement; but it directed them to notify the court and the other parties concerned when they intended to take down a loan, and reserved jurisdiction to modify its order with respect to any of these future borrowings.

C. C. 475, as modified in 328 I. C. C. 304 and 330 I. C. C. 328), that the merged system include the properties and operations of the New Haven. The Commission found that the merger would effectively destroy the ability of the New Haven to survive, and would not be in the public interest without the complete inclusion of the New Haven.
