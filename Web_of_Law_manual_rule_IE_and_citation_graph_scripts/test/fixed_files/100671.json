They departed from China on the Steamship President Lincoln, and upon arrival at San Francisco, July 11, 1924, sought permanent admission to the United States. The Secretary of Labor denied their applications and gave the following reasons therefor —</p>\n<p>\"Neither the mercantile status of the husband and father, nor the applicant's relationship to him, has been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> investigated for the reason that even if it were conceded that both these elements exist the applicants would be inadmissible as a matter of law. This is made necessary because of the inhibition against their coming to the United States as found in Paragraph (c) of Section 13 and that portion of Section 5 which reads as follows: `An alien who is not particularly specified in this Act as a nonquota immigrant or a non-immigrant shall not be admitted as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.'\"</p>\n<p>The court below has inquired, Jud. Code § 239: \"Are the alien Chinese wives and minor children of Chinese merchants who were lawfully domiciled within the United States prior to July 1st, 1924, such wives and minor children now applying for admission, mandatorily excluded from the United States under the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924?\"</p>\n<p>Prior to July 1, 1924, petitioners, if otherwise unobjectionable, might have been admitted notwithstanding their race and nationality. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mrs. Gue Lim,</i> 176 U.S. 459, 466, 468; <i>Yee Won</i> v. <i>White,</i> 256 U.S. 399, 400, 401. But it is said they are absolutely excluded by the \"Act to limit the immigration of aliens into the United States, and for other purposes,\" approved May 26, 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, applicable provisions of which follow —</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 13. . . .

When used in this Act the term `quota immigrant' means any immigrant who is not a non-quota immigrant. An alien who is not particularly specified in this Act as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant shall not be admitted as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.\"</p>\n<p>The present existing treaty of commerce and navigation with China, dated November 17, 1880, 22 Stat. 826, 827, provides —</p>\n<p>\"Article II. Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as teachers, students, merchants or from curiosity, together with their body and household servants, and Chinese laborers who are now in the United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.\"</p>\n<p>An alien entitled to enter the United States \"solely to carry on trade\" under an existing treaty of commerce and navigation is not an immigrant within the meaning of the Act, § 3(6), and therefore is not absolutely excluded by § 13.</p>\n<p>The wives and minor children of resident Chinese merchants were guaranteed the right of entry by the treaty of 1880 and certainly possessed it prior to July first when the present Immigration Act became effective. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mrs. Gue Lim, supra</i><i>.</i> That Act must be construed with the view to preserve treaty rights unless clearly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> annulled, and we cannot conclude that, considering its history, the general terms therein disclose a congressional intent absolutely to exclude the petitioners from entry.</p>\n<p>In a certain sense it is true that petitioners did not come \"solely to carry on trade.\" But Mrs. Gue Lim did not come as a \"merchant.\" She was nevertheless allowed to enter, upon the theory that a treaty provision admitting merchants by necessary implication extended to their wives and minor children.
