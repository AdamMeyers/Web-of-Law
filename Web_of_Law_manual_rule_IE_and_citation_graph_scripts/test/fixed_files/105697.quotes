<quote local_id="2059" start="8374" end="9177" string="&quot;Although even these state court decisions may lead to possible conflict between the federal labor board and state courts they do not present potentialities of conflicts in kind or degree which require a hands-off directive to the states. A state court decision requiring restoration of membership requires consideration of and judgment upon matters wholly outside the scope of the National Labor Relations Board's determination with reference to employer discrimination after union ouster from membership. The state court proceedings deal with arbitrariness and misconduct vis-a-vis the individual union members and the union; the Board proceeding, *623 looking principally to the nexus between union action and employer discrimination, examines the ouster from membership in entirely different terms.&quot;"></quote>

Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, 348 U.S. 468, 479;[3]United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 347 U.S. 656, 663, 665.[4] And if elucidating litigation was required to dispel the Delphic nature of that doctrine, the requisite concreteness has been adequately supplied. This Court has consistently turned back efforts to utilize state remedies for conduct subject to proceedings for relief under the Federal Act. District Lodge 34, Int'l *625 Assn. of Machinists v. L. P. Cavett Co., 355 U. S. 39; Local Union 429, Int'l Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. Farnsworth &amp; Chambers Co., 353 U. S. 969; Retail Clerks International Assn. v. J. J. Newberry Co., 352 U.

<quote local_id="2062" start="12523" end="13129" string="&quot;[5] for the state relief there being sustained.[6] The principles declared in Garner v. Teamsters C. &amp; H. Local Union, supra, were not the product of imperfect consideration or untried hypothesis. They comprise the fundamental doctrines that have guided this Court's preemption decisions for over a century. When Congress, acting in a field of dominant federal interest as part of a comprehensive scheme of federal regulation, confers rights and creates remedies with respect to certain conduct, it has expressed its judgment on the desirable scope of regulation, and state action to supplement it is as &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2063" start="13141" end="13914" string="&quot; offensive and invalid as state action in derogation. E. g., Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U. S. 497; Missouri *626 P. R. Co. v. Porter, 273 U. S. 341; Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 21-23. This is as true of a state common-law right of action as it is of state regulatory legislation. Texas &amp; P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426. As recently as Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, 353 U.S. 1, we had occasion to re-emphasize the vitality of these pre-emption doctrines in a labor case where, due to NLRB inaction, the conduct involved was either subject to state regulation or it was wholly unregulated. We set aside a state-court remedial order directed at activity that had been the subject of unfair labor practice charges with the Board, declaring that: &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2064" start="14116" end="14384" string="&quot;[7] That the foregoing principles of pre-emption apply to the type of dispute involved in this case cannot be doubted. Comment hardly need be made upon the comprehensive nature of the federal labor regulation in the Taft-Hartley Act. One of its declared purposes is &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2065" start="14514" end="15845" string="&quot;[8] The Act deals with the very conduct involved in this case by declaring in § 8 (b) (2) that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment against an employee who has been denied union membership on some ground other than failure to tender periodic dues.[9] The evidence disclosed the probability of a § 8 (b) (2) unfair labor practice in the union's refusal to *627 dispatch Gonzales from its hiring hall after his expulsion from membership and his inability thereafter to obtain employment. If a causal relation between the nondispatch and the refusal to hire is an essential element of § 8 (b) (2),[10] there was ample evidence to satisfy that requirement. A few months after Gonzales' expulsion, the union signed a multiemployer collective bargaining agreement with a hiring-hall provision. One witness testified that there was no material difference between hiring procedures before and after the date of that agreement.[11] There were other indications to the same effect.[12] In any event, since the uncontested facts disclose the probability of a § 8 (b) (2) unfair labor practice, the existence of the same must for pre-emption purposes be assumed. As we said in Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, supra, at 478, &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2066" start="15966" end="16651" string="&quot; Assuming that the union conduct involved constituted a § 8 (b) (2) unfair labor practice,[13] the existence of a conflict of remedies in this case cannot be denied. Section 10 (c) of the Act empowers the Board to redress such conduct by requiring the responsible party to reimburse the worker for the pay he has lost. Relying upon the identical conduct on which the Board would premise its back-pay *628 award,[14] the state court has required of the union precisely what the Board would require: that Gonzales be made whole for his lost wages. Such a duplication and conflict of remedies is the very thing this Court condemned in Garner. The further recovery of $2,500 damages for &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2067" start="16693" end="17413" string="&quot; serves to aggravate the evil. When Congress proscribed union-inspired job discriminations and provided for a recovery of lost wages by the injured party, it created all the relief it thought necessary to accomplish its purpose. Any additional redress under state law for the same conduct cannot avoid disturbing this delicate balance of rights and remedies. The right of action for emotional disturbance, like the punitive recovery the plaintiff sought unsuccessfully in this case, is a particularly unwelcome addition to the scheme of federal remedies because of the random nature of any assessment of damages. Without a reliable gauge to which to relate their verdict, a jury may fix an amount in response to those &quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2068" start="17470" end="18637" string="&quot; from which the Garner case sought to isolate national labor regulation. The prospect of such recoveries will inevitably exercise a regulatory effect on labor relations. The state and federal courts that have considered the permissibility of damage actions for the victims of job discrimination lend their weight to the foregoing conclusion. While most sustain the State's power to reinstate members wrongfully ousted from the union, they are unanimous in denying the State's power to award damages *629 for the employer discriminations that result from nonmembership.[15] The legislative history and structure of the Federal Act lend further support to a conclusion of pre-emption. While § 8 (b) (2) and the other provisions defining unfair labor practices on the part of labor organizations were first introduced in the Taft-Hartley Act, similar conduct by an employer had been an unfair labor practice under § 8 (3) of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 452. Committee reports dealing with that provision leave no doubt that the Congress was prescribing a complete code of federal labor regulation that did not contemplate actions in the state court for the same conduct. &quot;"></quote>

<quote local_id="2077" start="23190" end="24320" string="&quot;In determining the question of whether the exclusive jurisdiction to grant damages in a case of this kind lies in the Labor Relations Board, it is first necessary to determine the character of the pleadings and issues in this case. The petition alleged a breach of contract between the union and plaintiff, one of its members. . . . It took the form of a petition for writ of mandate because damages alone would not be adequate to restore to petitioner the things of value he had lost by reason of the breach. No charge of `unfair labor practices' appears in the petition. The answer to the petition denied its allegations and challenged the jurisdiction of the court, but said nothing about unfair labor practices. The evidence adduced at the trial showed that plaintiff, because of his loss of membership, was unable to obtain employment and was thereby damaged. However, this damage was not charged nor treated as the result of an unfair labor practice but as a result of the breach of contract. Thus the question of unfair labor practice was not raised nor was any finding on the subject requested of, or made by, the court.&quot;"></quote>
<quote local_id="2078" start="24422" end="24598" string="&quot;In Garner the emphasis was not on two conflicting labor statutes but rather on two similar remedies, one state and one federal, brought to bear on precisely the same conduct.&quot;"></quote>
