Three widely divergent constructions of paragraph (12) are urged. The railroads contend that it prescribes a rule of distribution complete in itself; that the rule there prescribed is the Hocking Valley-Traer rule; and that the provision neither requires nor permits action by the Commission supplementary thereto. In support of this view *577 the congressional history of the provision is particularly relied upon. The United States contends also that paragraph (12) prescribes a complete rule of car distribution; but its insistence is that the statute abolished the Hocking Valley-Traer rule and substituted for it a rule identical with that ordered by the Commission. Support for its view is sought particularly in the penalty provision of paragraph (12), in the provision of paragraph (10) which defines car service, and in paragraph (11) which prohibits any unjust and unreasonable practice in respect to car service. The Commission contends that paragraph (12) does not prescribe a complete rule; that it does not require either pro rata distribution of cars or distribution according to the Hocking Valley-Traer rule; that it requires merely that all cars be counted as the basis for determining the pro rata share of each mine; and that it leaves to the Commission administrative discretion to determine how the cars shall be distributed. The Commission's contention is, in our opinion, the sound one. It gives effect to the command that all cars shall be counted; and it leaves full scope both to the duty imposed upon the carriers in paragraph (11), and to the authority conferred upon the Commission in paragraph (14), to establish reasonable rules with respect to car service. This construction is consistent also with the legislative history of the provision, including the action of the conference committee by which the differences between the Senate and House bills were reconciled.[7]
*578 One other question of statutory construction is urged by the railroads. They deny the authority of the Commission to deal with the distribution of railroad fuel cars. They point to paragraph 10 of § 1, which defines &quot;">
<quote local_id="127" start="19379" end="19420" string="&quot; as including the distribution of cars &quot;">
<quote local_id="128" start="19459" end="20460" string="&quot; The contention is that, because of the phrase quoted, the Commission's authority to make reasonable regulations with respect to car service, conferred by paragraph (14), is limited to the supervision of the performance by railroads of their common-carrier duties of transportation for the public, and does not extend to supervision of their activity in securing fuel for use by the carrier. The contention is, in our opinion, groundless. So far as concerns foreign railroad fuel cars, the owner is obviously in the same position as a private shipper.[8] Carrying coal by a railroad for its own use as fuel is likewise transportation. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 215 U.S. 452, 474. It would require very explicit language to convince us that Congress intended to permit discrimination if effected by the use of railroad fuel cars. Moreover, the phrase in question appears also in paragraph 12, which provides that the carrier must count against the mine all cars used &quot;">
<quote local_id="129" start="20487" end="22459" string="&quot;
Third. It is contended that the rule prescribed is void because unreasonable. Most of the evidence and much of the briefs and arguments were directed to showing the hardships, waste and losses which would result from the prescribed restriction on the use of assigned cars. Private car owners urge that assigned car mines will be compelled *579 to reduce loadings to conform to the average of system car mines; that private coal cars, representing large investment and sorely needed by their owners, will stand idle on the tracks; that steel industries will be partially or completely shut down and thousands of steel workers will be thrown out of employment; that coke and by-product companies will be partially or completely shut down and their employees temporarily deprived of their means of livelihood; that public utility companies will be compelled to resort to the unsatisfactory and uneconomic spot market for coal; that the supply of gas and electricity to the public will be seriously curtailed; that coal burning steamships will be delayed in sailing; and that the further development and expansion of the important by-product coke process will cease. The railroads urge that the prescribed rule will deprive them of the only effective means of procuring at all times, in dependable volume, suitable coal essential to their operation; that it will increase the cost of coal to them by preventing their running at full capacity the mines owned by them or those whose product they contract for; that it will increase the cost of operation also by depriving them of coal of uniform and approved quality; that in times of greatest car shortage it will involve the non-use by them of a large number of unused private cars; and that it will otherwise prevent efficient transportation service.
There was much evidence that the practice which had been sanctioned in the Hocking Valley-Traer cases did not operate satisfactorily. The Commission concluded that it was &quot;">
<quote local_id="130" start="22495" end="24871" string="&quot; Compare Hillsdale Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 19 I.C.C. 356, 387. The effort to formulate a rule which would prevent discrimination was resumed. The Commission found that the existing assigned-car practice reduces to a certain extent the supply of cars furnished to commercial mines; that the larger and steadier supply of *580 cars gives the assigned-car mines a great advantage in steadiness of operation, and hence in cost of production, in the selling markets, and in the labor market; and that, apart from the discrimination inherent in the assigned-car rule, the carriers have been guilty of other willful discriminatory practices, which, as a practical matter, it would be difficult to prevent as long as the rule prevailed. It found also that the use of private cars tends more and more to produce inequalities in the use of other facilities, such as locomotives, tracks, and terminals; and that many, at least, of the so-called car shortages have been due not to an absence of cars but to an inability to move them, i. e., to a shortage of such other facilities. It found, also, that the railroads could, by various devices, obviate most of the difficulty in securing fuel, which they anticipated would result from the order here attacked.
The argument most strongly urged is that, because the rule prescribes absolute uniformity, regardless of the necessities of the railroad or other consumer, regardless of the ownership of the mine or the cars, regardless of the character of the business done by the mine or its customer, it is necessarily unreasonable, and, hence, that the order is void. But the authority to establish reasonable rules conferred by paragraph (14) includes power to prescribe a rule of universal application. There was ample evidence to support the Commission's findings. It is not for courts to weigh the evidence introduced before the Commission, Western Papermakers' Chemical Co. v. United States, 271 U.S. 268, 271; or to enquire into the soundness of the reasoning by which its conclusions are reached, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., 215 U.S. 452, 471; Skinner &amp; Eddy Corporation v. United States, 249 U.S. 557, 562; or to question the wisdom of regulations which it prescribes. United States v. New River Co., 265 U.S. 533, 542, *581 These are matters left by Congress to the administrative &quot;">
<quote local_id="131" start="24924" end="36087" string="&quot; Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 206 U.S. 441, 454.
We cannot say that it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the Commission to conclude that good service could be secured by a uniform rule which might be departed from with its consent and that unjust discrimination could not be prevented without such a uniform rule. It acted in the light of a rich experience. It had learned by experience that the existing practices resulted in discrimination and unsatisfactory service. It had learned, also through experience, that the emergency powers conferred by the Transportation Act, 1920, afforded adequate means of supplying the needs and of averting the possible hardships and losses, of carriers and of private coal consumers, to which the evidence and arguments had been largely directed.[9] For the Commission had had much experience in applying these emergency powers in connection with this distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage, before it prescribed the rule here challenged.[10] Moreover, so *582 far as concerns railroad fuel cars the operation of the rule as modified from time to time by emergency orders would resemble the practice of the Car Service Section of the Railroad Administration during federal control.[11]
Fourth. The contention that findings of the Commission concerning discrimination were unsupported by evidence, or that findings essential to the order are lacking, rests largely upon a misconception. This objection was directed particularly to the finding that the existing practice *583 in regard to assigned cars results in giving to the mines enjoying assigned cars an unjust and unreasonable share of railroad services and of facilities other than cars. The claim is that the evidence, upon which the finding of the resulting discrimination in these other transportation facilities rests, relates to only a few carriers, and that the general finding to that effect is without support, because the evidence introduced was not shown to be typical. Compare New England Divisions Case, 261 U.S. 184, 196-197; United States v. Abilene &amp; Southern Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 291. The argument overlooks the difference in the character between a general rule prescribed under paragraph (12) and a practice for particular carriers ordered or prohibited under §§ 1, 3 and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act. In the cases cited, the Commission was determining the relative rights of the several carriers in a joint rate. It was making a partition; and it performed a function quasi-judicial in its nature. In the case at bar, the function exercised by the Commission is wholly legislative. Its authority to legislate is limited to establishing a reasonable rule. But in establishing a rule of general application, it is not a condition of its validity that there be adduced evidence of its appropriateness in respect to every railroad to which it will be applicable. In this connection, the Commission, like other legislators, may reason from the particular to the general.
Fifth. Equally unfounded is the contention that, under the guise of regulating carrier instrumentalities, the Commission is seeking to equalize industrial fortune and opportunity. The object of the rule was not to equalize fortunes, but to prevent an unjust discrimination in the use of transportation facilities and to improve the service. In essence, the power exerted is the same as that sustained in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., 215 U.S. 452, where it was held that *584 the Commission had power to prohibit the use of any system car, if the private cars assigned to the mine equalled its quota. The fact that Congress has permitted the use of private cars, and that the shippers' acquisition of them proceeds from the motive of self-interest which is recognized as legitimate, cannot prevent the Commission from prohibiting a use of the equipment in a way which it concludes will probably result in unjust discrimination against others and may prove detrimental otherwise to the transportation service. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., 263 U.S. 515, 523, 524; Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 663-665. The contention is admittedly baseless if, as we have concluded, there is evidence to support the finding that the assigned-car practice causes discrimination in the use of other transportation facilities. For the appellees concede that the possession of private cars confers upon them no superior claim to other services.
The order challenged is valid. The bills must be dismissed. The decrees are
Reversed. The separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS.
A temperate and dependable statement concerning the scope and effect of the order here challenged, taken from the brief of counsel for appellees, is printed in the margin.[*] And see the carefully-prepared opinion of the *585 court below, Berwind-White Coal-Mining Co. et al. v. United States, 9 Fed. (2d) 429.
To me it seems plain enough that the real purpose of the order was not rationally to control distribution of *586 cars during times of shortage, but to force railroads and other large consumers to apportion their purchases of coal among a larger number of producers and thus advantage mines from which such consumers preferred not to buy. Both carrier and large manufacturer must have steady supplies of suitable coal, and it may be highly important to obtain these from one or a few approved mines. But if such mines are to be denied fuel and private cars during times of shortage, then for their reasonable protection *587 these great consumers probably will endeavor to scatter their orders.
The railroads of this country are private property. They must be operated by their owners according to law under supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission; but that body is not intrusted with their management and ought not to be permitted to assume it under any guise. In practice, carriers must use many cars daily for gathering fuel necessary for their operations, and I know of no authority possessed by the Commission to prevent them from purchasing this where and as their managers think best. To permit such interference under the mere guise of a rule for distribution of cars seems to me altogether wrong.
Upon this record we must assume that the carriers have met their obligation to provide an adequate number of system cars.
The practice of hiring and using private cars by railroad has been recognized and accepted by both Congress and the Commission. It has enlarged the total number of cars available for use and thereby aided all shippers. Those who provide private cars take nothing from any other shipper, but heretofore have secured the use of such cars for themselves although, because of temporary shortage, the system cars were insufficient to meet the demands of others.
If the order was intended to enlarge the total supply of cars or bring about more equitable distribution of available cars in times of shortage, it was foolish. Supply cannot be increased, nor equitable distribution enforced, by prohibiting the use of private or fuel cars when most needed — requiring them to stand idle on the sidings. If, on the other hand, as I must think, the real purpose was to force large consumers to scatter their purchases, the order goes beyond any power intrusted to the Commission.
The decree below should be affirmed.

[10]  In some cases the emergency order was made applicable to all the railroads of the United States; in some only to carriers within a particular district. In some cases the emergency order applied to many carriers and many mining districts; in others to only a single carrier or a single district. In some cases the order applied only to shipments to a particular destination or for a particular purpose or by a particular route; in others the order was not so restricted. In some cases the order governed the shipments until further notice; in some the period was fixed. In some cases there were suspensions. In some cases the order was limited to shipments of a specified amount of coal to a particular consignee. In some cases the order was limited to cars of a particular description. In some the amount to be shipped by each of several carriers was limited. In some the order applied only to mines of a particular character. In some the limitation depended upon the particular conditions existing at the mines. In every case the emergency order recites in general terms the facts found by the Commission as a justification for its action.
