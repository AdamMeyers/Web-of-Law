<quote local_id="2673" start="2856" end="4856" string="&quot;It appears to the court that complainants, at and before the making of said pretended transfer and conveyance, were, and still are, creditors of the said John W. Broughton, and that the amount due each of them respectively, including interest to this date, is as follows: Dunham, Buckley &amp; Co., ten thousand two hundred and twenty-two 50/100 dollars ($10,222.50); Edwin Bates &amp; Co., four thousand three hundred and ninty-one 08/100 dollars ($4,391.08); John I. Adams &amp; Co., seven hundred and six 37/100 dollars ($706.37) and Katz &amp; Barnett, nine hundred and thirty 82/100 dollars ($930.82). Total, sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty 77/100 dollars ($16,250.77). It appears to the court that the defendant John W. Broughton is insolvent, and without property or means, and that the defendants Stewart Bros. &amp; Co. had in their hands and possession, at the time of filing the bill of complaint in this cause, and still have, property, assets, and money, being the same fraudulently transferred and conveyed to them by the defendant John W. Broughton, as aforesaid, and the proceeds of the same, amounting to a sum largely in excess of the said sum of $16,250.77, due complainants as aforesaid. It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the defendants, John W. Broughton and Andrew Stewart, Andrew D. Gwynne, and P.H. Haley, composing the firm of Stewart Bros. &amp; Co., do pay to the complainants the above-mentioned sums respectively due them, with interest thereon at the rate of six (6) per cent. per annum from this date until paid, that is to say: To Dunham, Buckley &amp; Co., ten thousand two hundred and twenty-two 50/100 dollars ($10,222.50); to Edwin Bates &amp; Co., four thousand three hundred and ninetyone *64 08/100 dollars ($4,391.08); to Katz and Barnett, nine hundred and thirty 82/100 dollars ($930.82); and to John I. Adams &amp; Co., seven hundred and six 37/100 dollars ($706.37); for which amounts and costs executions in favor of said creditors respectively may issue as at law.&quot;">
