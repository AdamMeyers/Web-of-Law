<quote local_id="1417" start="11227" end="11481" string="&quot;At the end of the term the parties are discharged from further attendance on all cases decided and we have no power to bring them back.

<quote local_id="1418" start="11637" end="12758" string="&quot;But it is a rule equally well established, that after the term has ended all final judgments and decrees of the court pass beyond its control, unless steps be taken during that term, by motion or otherwise, to set aside, modify, or correct *152 them; and if errors exist, they can only be corrected by such proceeding by a writ of error or appeal as may be allowed in a court which, by law, can review the decision. So strongly has this principle been upheld by this court, that while realizing that there is no court which can review its decisions, it has invariably refused all applications for rehearing made after the adjournment of the court for the term at which the judgment was rendered. And this is placed upon the ground that the case has passed beyond the control of the court. Brooks v. Railroad Company, 102 U.S. 107; Public Schools v. Walker, 9 Wall. 603; Brown v. Aspden, 14 How. 25; Cameron v. McRoberts, 3 Wheat. 591; Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488; United States v. The Brig Glamorgan, 2 Curt. C.C. 236; Bradford v. Patterson, 1 A.K. Marsh.

<quote local_id="1419" start="14005" end="14672" string="&quot;The judgment was the one the court intended to enter, and the facts found were those only which the court intended to find. There is here no clerical mistake. Nothing was omitted from the record of the original action which the court intended to make a matter of record. The case, therefore, does not come within the rule that a court, after the expiration of the term, may, by an order nunc pro tunc, amend the record by inserting what had been omitted by the act of the clerk or of the court. In re Wight, Petitioner, 134 U.S. 136, 144; Fowler v. Equitable Trust Company 141 U.S. 384; Galloway v. McKeithen, 5 Iredell (Law), 12; Hyde v. Curling, 10 Missouri, 227.&quot;">

<quote local_id="1422" start="15742" end="16209" string="&quot;But a well known exception to this general rule is that a judgment of dismissal based upon a mistake or inadvertence, such as appears in this record, can be set aside after the term, and that is the proposition with which this court is concerned in this case. The reason is that jurisdiction is not lost by a *154 dismissal by a mistake.

<quote local_id="1423" start="16724" end="17366" string="&quot;The difference between a new appeal and a reinstatement of the old appeal after a dismissal, from a misprision of the clerk, is not admitted by this court justly to involve any difference of right as to the stipulators. Every court must be presumed to exercise those powers belonging to it which are necessary for the promotion of public justice; and we do not doubt that this court possesses the power to reinstate any cause dismissed by mistake. The reinstatement of the cause was founded, in the opinion of this court, upon the plain principles of justice and is according to the known practice of other judicial tribunals in like cases.&quot;">

<quote local_id="1428" start="22467" end="24089" string="&quot;Although the opinion [Bronson case] also shows that upon the facts of that case the action of the Circuit Court in vacating its judgment after the term could not be justified upon any rule authorizing such relief, whether by motion or by bill in equity, nevertheless the decision rests upon the emphatic denial of the power of the court to set aside a judgment upon motion made after the term and grant a new trial, except in the limited class of cases enumerated as reached by the previous practice under writs of error coram vobis, or for the purpose of correcting the record according to the fact where mistakes have occurred from the misprision of the clerk. We content ourselves with repeating the doctrine of this recent decision, without recapitulating previous decisions in this court, in the point which has been noticed, for the purpose of showing their harmony. It has been the uniform doctrine of this court. `No principle is better settled,' it was said in Sibbald v. The United States, 12 Pet. 487, 492, `or of more universal application, than that no court can reverse its own final decrees or judgments for errors of fact or law, after the term in which they have been rendered, unless for clerical mistakes; Cameron v. McRoberts, 3 Wheat. 591; Bank v. Wistar, 3 Pet. 431; or to reinstate a cause dismissed by mistake, The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1; from which it follows that no change or modification can be made, which may substantially vary or affect it in any material thing. Bills of review, cases in equity, and writs of error coram vobis at law, are exceptions which cannot affect the present motion.'&quot;">
