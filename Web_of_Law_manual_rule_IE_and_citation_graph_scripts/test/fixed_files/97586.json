So it has been decided that in cases tried in the United States courts we must follow our own understanding of the common law when no settled rule of property intervenes. <i>Kuhn</i> v. <i>Fairmont Coal Co.,</i> 215 U.S. 349. <i>Northern Pacific R.R.

No testimony can shake the obvious fact that the character of their respective occupations brought the people engaged in them into necessary and frequent contact, although they may have had no personal relations. Every time that a car was to be repaired it had to be switched into the repair yard. There is no room for the exception to the rule that exists where the negligence consists in the undisclosed failure to furnish a safe place to work in, an exception that perhaps has been pushed to an extreme in the effort to limit the rule. <i>Santa Fe Pacific R.R.
