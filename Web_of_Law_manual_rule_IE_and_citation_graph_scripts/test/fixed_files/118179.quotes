The Kawaauhaus urge that the malpractice award fits within this exception because Dr. Geiger intentionally rendered inadequate medical care to Margaret Kawaauhau that necessarily led to her injury. According to the Kawaauhaus, Geiger deliberately chose less effective treatment because he wanted to cut costs, all the while knowing that he was providing substandard care. Such conduct, the Kawaauhaus assert, meets the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1373" start="4424" end="4519" string="&quot; specification of § 523(a)(6).
We confront this pivotal question concerning the scope of the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1374" start="4547" end="4836" string="&quot; exception: Does § 523(a)(6)'s compass cover acts, done intentionally,[3] that cause injury (as the Kawaauhaus urge), or only acts done with the actual intent to cause injury (as the Eighth Circuit ruled)? The words of the statute strongly support the Eighth Circuit's reading.
The word &quot;">
<quote local_id="1375" start="4843" end="4874" string="&quot; in (a)(6) modifies the word &quot;">
<quote local_id="1376" start="4881" end="5145" string="&quot; indicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury, not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury. Had Congress meant to exempt debts resulting from unintentionally inflicted injuries, it might have described instead &quot;">
<quote local_id="1377" start="5176" end="5249" string="&quot; Or, Congress might have selected an additional word or words, i. e.,  &quot;">
<quote local_id="1378" start="5257" end="5263" string="&quot; or &quot;">
<quote local_id="1379" start="5273" end="5286" string="&quot; to modify &quot;">
<quote local_id="1380" start="5293" end="5404" string="&quot; Moreover, as the Eighth Circuit observed, the (a)(6) formulation triggers in the lawyer's mind the category &quot;">
<quote local_id="1381" start="5422" end="5534" string="&quot; as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts. Intentional torts generally require that the actor intend &quot;">
<quote local_id="1382" start="5568" end="5582" string="&quot; not simply &quot;">
<quote local_id="1383" start="5597" end="6154" string="&quot; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 8A, Comment a, p. 15 (1964) (emphasis added).
The Kawaauhaus' more encompassing interpretation could place within the excepted category a wide range of situations in which an act is intentional, but injury is unintended, i. e.,  neither desired nor in fact anticipated by the debtor. Every traffic accident stemming from an initial intentional act—f example, intentionally rotating the wheel of an automobile to make a left-hand turn without first checking oncoming traffic—c fit the description. See 113 F. 3d, at 852. A &quot;">
<quote local_id="1384" start="6180" end="6269" string="&quot; could also qualify. See ibid.  A construction so broad would be incompatible with the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1385" start="6279" end="6317" string="&quot; guide that exceptions to discharge &quot;">
<quote local_id="1386" start="6363" end="6422" string="&quot; Gleason v. Thaw, 236 U.S. 558, 562 (1915).
Furthermore, &quot;">
<quote local_id="1387" start="6553" end="6750" string="&quot; Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 837 (1988). Reading § 523(a)(6) as the Kawaauhaus urge would obviate the need for § 523(a)(9), which specifically exempts debts &quot;">
<quote local_id="1388" start="6946" end="7017" string="&quot; 11 U. S. C. § 523(a)(9); see also § 523(a)(12) (exempting debts for &quot;">
<quote local_id="1389" start="7046" end="7276" string="&quot; to fulfill certain commitments owed to a federal depository institutions regulatory agency).[4]
The Kawaauhaus heavily rely on Tinker v. Colwell, 193 U.S. 473 (1904), which presented this question: Does an award of damages for &quot;">
<quote local_id="1390" start="7297" end="7415" string="&quot; survive bankruptcy under the 1898 Bankruptcy Act's exception from *63 discharge for judgments in civil actions for &quot;">
<quote local_id="1391" start="7485" end="7644" string="&quot;? Id.,  at 480. The Tinker Court held such an award a nondischargeable debt. The Kawaauhaus feature certain statements in the Tinker opinion, in particular: &quot;">
<quote local_id="1392" start="7718" end="7739" string="&quot; even if performed &quot;">
<quote local_id="1393" start="7769" end="7797" string="&quot; id., at 485; an act that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1394" start="7958" end="8045" string="&quot; id., at 487. See also id., at 486 (the statute exempts from discharge liability for &quot;">
<quote local_id="1395" start="8112" end="8477" string="&quot;) (quoting from definition of malice in Bromage v. Prosser, 4 Barn. &amp; Cress. 247, 107 Eng. Rep. 1051 (K. B. 1825)).
The exposition in the Tinker opinion is less than crystalline. Counterbalancing the portions the Kawaauhaus emphasize, the Tinker Court repeatedly observed that the tort in question qualified in the common law as trespassory. Indeed, it ranked as &quot;">
<quote local_id="1396" start="8499" end="8599" string="&quot; 193 U. S., at 482, 483. Criminal conversation, the Court noted, was an action akin to a master's &quot;">
<quote local_id="1397" start="8667" end="8969" string="&quot; id., at 482. Tinker thus placed criminal conversation solidly within the traditional intentional tort category, and we so confine its holding. That decision, we clarify, provides no warrant for departure from the current statutory instruction that, to be nondischargeable, the judgment debt must be &quot;">
<quote local_id="1398" start="9003" end="9134" string="&quot;
Subsequent decisions of this Court are in accord with our construction. In McIntyre v. Kavanaugh, 242 U.S. 138 (1916), a broker &quot;">
<quote local_id="1399" start="9240" end="9642" string="&quot; Id., at 141. The Court held that this act constituted an intentional injury to property of another, bringing it within the discharge exception. But in Davis v. Aetna Ac-  *64 ceptance Co., 293 U.S. 328 (1934), the Court explained that not every tort judgment for conversion is exempt from discharge. Negligent or reckless acts, the Court held, do not suffice to establish that a resulting injury is &quot;">
<quote local_id="1400" start="9663" end="10878" string="&quot; See id., at 332.
Finally, the Kawaauhaus maintain that, as a policy matter, malpractice judgments should be excepted from discharge, at least when the debtor acted recklessly or carried no malpractice insurance. Congress, of course, may so decide. But unless and until Congress makes such a decision, we must follow the current direction § 523(a)(6) provides.

* * *
We hold that debts arising from recklessly or negligently inflicted injuries do not fall within the compass of § 523(a)(6). For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is
Affirmed.
