Finally, many of the scholarly authorities the majority cites in support of its overruling of Schwinn have not had to strain to distinguish location clauses from the restrictions invalidated there. E. g., Robinson, Recent Antitrust Developments: 1974, 75 Colum. L.

<quote local_id="1076" start="35435" end="35797" string="&quot;).
Just as there are significant differences between Schwinn and this case with respect to intrabrand competition, there are also significant differences with respect to interbrand competition. Unlike Schwinn, Sylvania clearly had no economic power in the generic product market. At the time they instituted their respective distribution policies, Schwinn was &quot;">
<quote local_id="1077" start="35840" end="35929" string="&quot; with a national market share of 22.5%, 388 U. S., at 368, 374, whereas Sylvania was a &quot;">
<quote local_id="1078" start="35954" end="35991" string="&quot; producer of television sets, with &quot;">
<quote local_id="1079" start="36026" end="36275" string="&quot; share of the national market in which the dominant manufacturer had a 60% to 70% share. Ante, at 38, 58 n. 29. Moreover, the Schwinn brand name enjoyed superior consumer acceptance and commanded a premium price as, in the District Court's words, &quot;">
<quote local_id="1080" start="36312" end="36926" string="&quot; 237 F. Supp., at 335. This premium gave Schwinn dealers a margin of *64 protection from interbrand competition and created the possibilities for price cutting by discounters that the Government argued were forestalled by Schwinn's customer restrictions.[3] Thus, judged by the criteria economists use to measure market powerโp differentiation and market share[4]โS enjoyed a substantially stronger position in the bicycle market than did Sylvania in the television market. This Court relied on Schwinn's market position as one reason not to apply the rule of reason to the vertical restraints challenged there. &quot;">
<quote local_id="1081" start="37146" end="37205" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 374. And the Court of Appeals below found &quot;">

<quote local_id="1084" start="37432" end="37596" string="&quot; 537 F. 2d, at 991.[5]
*65 In my view there are at least two considerations, both relied upon by the majority to justify overruling Schwinn, that would provide a &quot;">
<quote local_id="1085" start="37612" end="37699" string="&quot; for instead refusing to extend Schwinn to a vertical restraint that is imposed by a &quot;">
<quote local_id="1086" start="37708" end="37731" string="&quot; manufacturer with a &quot;">
<quote local_id="1087" start="37741" end="37852" string="&quot; position in a generic product market dominated by another firm. The first is that, as the majority puts it, &quot;">
<quote local_id="1088" start="38098" end="38510" string="&quot; Ante, at 52 n. 19. See also ante, at 54.[6] Second is the view, argued forcefully in the economic literature cited by the majority, that the potential benefits of vertical restraints in promoting interbrand competition are particularly strong where the manufacturer imposing the restraints is seeking to enter a new market or to expand a small market share. Ibid.[7] The majority even recognizes that Schwinn &quot;">
<quote local_id="1089" start="38516" end="39035" string="&quot; at an exception for new entrants and failing firms from its per se rule. Ante, at 53-54, n. 22.
In other areas of antitrust law, this Court has not hesitated to base its rules of per se illegality in part on the defendant's market power. Indeed, in the very case from which the majority draws its standard for per se rules, Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958), the *66 Court stated the reach of the per se rule against tie-ins under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act as extending to all defendants with &quot;">
<quote local_id="1090" start="39178" end="39271" string="&quot; 356 U. S., at 6. And the Court subsequently approved an exception to this per se rule for &quot;">

<quote local_id="1092" start="39648" end="40004" string="&quot; I see no doctrinal obstacle to excluding firms with such minimal market power as Sylvania's from the reach of the Schwinn rule.[8]
I have, moreover, substantial misgivings about the approach the majority takes to overruling Schwinn. The reason for the distinction in Schwinn between sale and nonsale transactions was not, as the majority would have it, &quot;">
<quote local_id="1093" start="40116" end="40442" string="&quot; ante, at 52; the reason was rather, as Judge Browning argued in dissent below, the notion in many of our cases involving vertical restraints that independent *67 businessmen should have the freedom to dispose of the goods they own as they see fit. Thus the first case cited by the Court in Schwinn for the proposition that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1094" start="40594" end="40828" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 377, was this Court's seminal decision holding a series of resale-price-maintenance agreements per se illegal, Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911). In Dr. Miles the Court stated that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1095" start="40886" end="40953" string="&quot; citing Coke on Littleton, and emphasized that the case involved &quot;">
<quote local_id="1096" start="41043" end="41106" string="&quot; Id., at 404, 407-408. Mr. Justice Holmes stated in dissent: &quot;">
<quote local_id="1097" start="41413" end="42076" string="&quot; Id., at 411.
This concern for the freedom of the businessman to dispose of his own goods as he sees fit is most probably the explanation for two subsequent cases in which the Court allowed manufacturers to achieve economic results similar to that in Dr. Miles where they did not impose restrictions on dealers who had purchased their products. In United States v. Colgate &amp; Co., 250 U.S. 300 (1919), the Court found no antitrust violation in a manufacturer's policy of refusing to sell to dealers who failed to charge the manufacturer's suggested retail price and of terminating dealers who did not adhere to that price. It stated that the Sherman Act did not &quot;">
<quote local_id="1098" start="42265" end="42563" string="&quot; Id., at 307. In United States v. General Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476 (1926), the Court upheld resale-price-maintenance *68 agreements made by a patentee with its dealers who obtained its goods on a consignment basis. The Court distinguished Dr. Miles on the ground that the agreements there were &quot;">
<quote local_id="1099" start="42602" end="42618" string="&quot; and involved &quot;">
<quote local_id="1100" start="42778" end="42868" string="&quot; 272 U. S., at 487. By contrast, a manufacturer was free to contract with his agents to &quot;">
<quote local_id="1101" start="43043" end="43503" string="&quot; Id., at 488. Although these two cases have been called into question by subsequent decisions, see United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960), and Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13 (1964), their rationale runs through our case law in the area of distributional restraints. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 213 (1951), the Court held that an agreement to fix resale prices was per se illegal under ยง 1 because &quot;">
<quote local_id="1102" start="43674" end="44131" string="&quot; Accord, Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 152 (1968). See generally Judge Browning's dissent below, 537 F. 2d, at XXXX-XXXX; ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand Competition 29-31, 82-83, 87-91, 96-97 (1977); Blake &amp; Jones, Toward a Three-Dimensional Antitrust Policy, 65 Colum. L. Rev. 422, 427-436 (1965).
After summarily rejecting this concern, reflected in our interpretations of the Sherman Act, for &quot;">
<quote local_id="1103" start="44171" end="44229" string="&quot; ante, at 53 n. 21, the majority not surprisingly finds &quot;">
<quote local_id="1104" start="44245" end="44339" string="&quot; for Schwinn's distinction between sale and nonsale transactions because the distinction is &quot;">
<quote local_id="1105" start="44393" end="44721" string="&quot; Ante, at 56. But while according some weight to the businessman's *69 interest in controlling the terms on which he trades in his own goods may be anathema to those who view the Sherman Act as directed solely to economic efficiency,[9] this principle is without question more deeply embedded in our cases than the notions of &quot;">
<quote local_id="1106" start="44731" end="44808" string="&quot; effects and distributional efficiencies borrowed by the majority from the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1107" start="44848" end="45005" string="&quot; Ante, at 54-57. Perhaps the Court is right in partially abandoning this principle and in judging the instant nonprice vertical restraints solely by their &quot;">
<quote local_id="1108" start="45029" end="45361" string="&quot;; but the precedents which reflect this principle should not be so lightly rejected by the Court. The rationale of Schwinn is no doubt difficult to discern from the opinion, and it may be wrong; it is not, however, the aberration the majority makes it out to be here.
I have a further reservation about the majority's reliance on &quot;">
<quote local_id="1109" start="45385" end="45754" string="&quot; as the test for retaining per se rules regarding vertical restraints. It is common ground among the leading advocates of a purely economic approach to the question of distribution restraints that the economic arguments in favor of allowing vertical nonprice restraints generally apply to vertical price restraints as well.[10] Although *70 the majority asserts that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1110" start="45869" end="46104" string="&quot; ante, at 51 n. 18, I suspect this purported distinction may be as difficult to justify as that of Schwinn under the terms of the majority's analysis. Thus Professor Posner, in an article cited five times by the majority, concludes: &quot;">
<quote local_id="1111" start="46321" end="46456" string="&quot; Posner, supra, n. 7, at 298. Indeed, the Court has already recognized that resale price maintenance may increase output by inducing &quot;">
<quote local_id="1112" start="46480" end="47487" string="&quot; by dealers (such as additional retail outlets, advertising and promotion, and product servicing) that out-weighs the additional sales that would result from lower prices brought about by dealer price competition. Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, at 151 n. 7. These same output-enhancing possibilities of nonprice vertical restraints are relied upon by the majority as evidence of their social utility and economic soundness, ante, at 55, and as a justification for judging them under the rule of reason. The effect, if not the intention, of the Court's opinion is necessarily to call into question the firmly established per se rule against price restraints.
Although the case law in the area of distributional restraints has perhaps been less than satisfactory, the Court would do well to proceed more deliberately in attempting to improve it. In view of the ample reasons for distinguishing Schwinn from this case and in the absence of contrary congressional action, I would adhere to the principle that
&quot;">
<quote local_id="1113" start="47853" end="49767" string="&quot; Maple Flooring Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 U.S. 563, 579 (1925).
In order to decide this case, the Court need only hold that a location clause imposed by a manufacturer with negligible economic power in the product market has a competitive impact sufficiently less restrictive than the Schwinn restraints to justify a rule-of-reason standard, even if the same weight is given here as in Schwinn to dealer autonomy. I therefore concur in the judgment.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.
I would not overrule the per se rule stated in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co., 388 U.S. 365 (1967), and would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
NOTES
[*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Lawrence T. Zimmerman for the Associated Equipment Distributors; by Lloyd N. Cutler, James S. Campbell, William T. Lake, and Donald F. Turner for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn.; and by Philip F. Zeidman and John A. Dienelt for the International Franchise Assn.
[1]  RCA at that time was the dominant firm with as much as 60% to 70% of national television sales in an industry with more than 100 manufacturers.
[2]  The number of retailers selling Sylvania products declined significantly as a result of the change, but in 1965 there were at least two franchised Sylvania retailers in each metropolitan center of more than 100,000 population.
[3]  Sylvania imposed no restrictions on the right of the franchisee to sell the products of competing manufacturers.
[4]  Sylvania's market share in San Francisco was approximately 2.5%โh its national and northern California average.
[5]  There are in fact four corporate petitioners: Continental T. V., Inc., A &amp; G Sales, Sylpac, Inc., and S. A. M. Industries, Inc. All are owned in large part by the same individual, and all conducted business under the trade style of &quot;">

<quote local_id="1115" start="49891" end="51583" string="&quot;
[6]  Sylvania had achieved exceptional results in Sacramento, where its market share exceeded 15% in 1965.
[7]  In its findings of fact made in conjunction with Continental's plea for injunctive relief, the District Court rejected Sylvania's claim that its actions were prompted by independent concerns over Continental's credit. The jury's verdict is ambiguous on this point. In any event, we do not consider it relevant to the issue before us.
[8]  Although Sylvania contended in the District Court that its policy was unilaterally enforced, it now concedes that its location restriction involved understandings or agreements with the retailers.
[9]  The jury also found that Maguire had not conspired with Sylvania with respect to this violation. Other claims made by Continental were either rejected by the jury or withdrawn by Continental. Most important was the jury's rejection of the allegation that the location restriction was part of a larger scheme to fix prices. A pendent claim that Sylvania and Maguire had willfully and maliciously caused injury to Continental's business in violation of California law also was rejected by the jury, and a pendent breach-of-contract claim was withdrawn by Continental during the course of the proceedings. The parties eventually stipulated to a judgment for Maguire on its claim against Continental.
[10]  There were two major dissenting opinions. Judge Kilkenny argued that the present case is indistinguishable from Schwinn and that the jury had been correctly instructed. Agreeing with Judge Kilkenny's interpretation of Schwinn, Judge Browning stated that he found the interpretation responsive to and justified by the need to protect &quot;">
<quote local_id="1116" start="51663" end="52871" string="&quot; 537 F. 2d, at 1021. See n. 21, infra.
[11]  This Court has never given plenary consideration to the question of the proper antitrust analysis of location restrictions. Before Schwinn such restrictions had been sustained in Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 124 F.2d 822 (CA2 1942). Since the decision in Schwinn, location restrictions have been sustained by three Courts of Appeals, including the decision below. Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F.2d 567 (CA10 1975); Kaiser v. General Motors Corp., 396 F. Supp. 33 (ED Pa. 1975), affirmance order, 530 F.2d 964 (CA3 1976).
[12]  The distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals and endorsed in MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S separate opinion have no basis in Schwinn. The intrabrand competitive impact of the restrictions at issue in Schwinn ranged from complete elimination to mere reduction; yet, the Court did not even hint at any distinction on this ground. Similarly, there is no suggestion that the per se rule was applied because of Schwinn's prominent position in its industry. That position was the same whether the bicycles were sold or consigned, but the Court's analysis was quite different. In light of MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S emphasis on the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1117" start="52899" end="53132" string="&quot; enjoyed by the Schwinn brand name, post, at 63, we note that the Court rejected precisely that premise in Schwinn. Applying the rule of reason to the restrictions imposed in nonsale transactions, the Court stressed that there was &quot;">
<quote local_id="1118" start="53283" end="53302" string="&quot; and that it did &quot;">
<quote local_id="1119" start="53380" end="53715" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 381, and n. 7. Although Schwinn did hint at preferential treatment for new entrants and failing firms, the District Court below did not even submit Sylvania's claim that it was failing to the jury. Accordingly, MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S position appears to reflect an extension of Schwinn in this regard. Having crossed the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1120" start="53727" end="53939" string="&quot; line, MR. JUSTICE WHITE attempts neither to draw a new one nor to explain why one should be drawn at all.

[14]  Indeed, as one commentator has observed, many courts &quot;">
<quote local_id="1123" start="55610" end="55748" string="&quot; Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 272. Thus, the statement in Schwinn that post-sale vertical restrictions as to customers or territories are &quot;">
<quote local_id="1124" start="55774" end="55888" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 379, has been interpreted to allow an exception to the per se rule where the manufacturer proves &quot;">
<quote local_id="1125" start="55892" end="56184" string="&quot; by showing that the restraints will protect consumers against injury and the manufacturer against product liability claims. See, e. g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932, 936-938 (CA3 1970) (en banc). Similarly, the statement that Schwinn's enforcement of its restrictions had been &quot;">
<quote local_id="1126" start="56204" end="57455" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 372, has been relied upon to distinguish cases lacking that element. See, e. g., Janel Sales Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc., 396 F.2d 398, 406 (CA2 1968). Other factual distinctions have been drawn to justify upholding territorial restrictions that would seem to fall within the scope of the Schwinn per se rule. See, e. g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. United States, 196 Ct. Cl. 35, 44-46, 449 F.2d 1374, 1379-1380 (1971) (per se rule inapplicable when purchaser can avoid restraints by electing to buy product at higher price); Colorado Pump &amp; Supply Co. v. Febco, Inc., 472 F.2d 637 (CA10 1973) (apparent territorial restriction characterized as primary responsibility clause). One Court of Appeals has expressly urged us to consider the need in this area for greater flexibility. Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC, 497 F.2d 1178, 1187 (CA10 1974). The decision in Schwinn and the developments in the lower courts have been exhaustively surveyed in ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand Competition (1977) (ABA Monograph No. 2).
[15]  One of the most frequently cited statements of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918):

&quot;">
<quote local_id="1127" start="58274" end="60374" string="&quot;
[16]  Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial practices. The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences must be balanced against its pro-competitive consequences. Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them. Once established, per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S., at 5; United States v. Topco Associates, Ine., 405 U.S. 596, 609-610 (1972), but those advantages are not sufficient in themselves to justify the creation of per se rules. If it were otherwise, all of antitrust law would be reduced to per se rules, thus introducing an unintended and undesirable rigidity in the law.
[17]  After White Motor Co., the Courts of Appeals continued to evaluate territorial restrictions according to the rule of reason. Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 847 (CA6 1964); Snap-On Tools Corp. v. FTC, 321 F.2d 825 (CA7 1963). For an exposition of the history of the antitrust analysis of vertical restrictions before Schwinn, see ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 6-8.
[18]  As in Schwinn, we are concerned here only with nonprice vertical restrictions. The per se illegality of price restrictions has been established firmly for many years and involves significantly different questions of analysis and policy. As MR. JUSTICE WHITE notes, post, at 69-70, some commentators have argued that the manufacturer's motivation for imposing vertical price restrictions may be the same as for nonprice restrictions. There are, however, significant differences that could easily justify different treatment. In his concurring opinion in White Motor Co. v. United States, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN noted that, unlike nonprice restrictions, &quot;">
<quote local_id="1128" start="60595" end="60655" string="&quot; 372 U. S., at 268. Professor Posner also recognized that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1129" start="60723" end="62611" string="&quot; Posner, supra, n. 13, at 294 (footnote omitted); see R. Posner, Antitrust: Cases, Economic Notes and Other Materials 134 (1974); E. Gellhorn, Antitrust Law and Economics 252 (1976); Note, 10 Colum. J. L. &amp; Soc. Prob., supra, n. 13, at 498 n. 12. Furthermore, Congress recently has expressed its approval of a per se analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair-trade pricing at the option of the individual States. Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801, amending 15 U. S. C. ยงยง 1, 45 (a). No similar expression of congressional intent exists for nonprice restrictions.
[19]  Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic productโt sets in this caseโa is the primary concern of antitrust law. The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributorsโw or retailโo the product of a particular manufacturer.

The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry. But when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.
[20]  The Court did not specifically refer to intrabrand competition, but this meaning is clear from the context.
[21]  The Court also stated that to impose vertical restrictions in sale transactions would &quot;">
<quote local_id="1130" start="62669" end="62864" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 380. This isolated reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the commentators on the decision, most of whom have regarded the Court's apparent reliance on the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1131" start="62876" end="63195" string="&quot; as both a misreading of legal history and a perversion of antitrust analysis. See, e. g., Handler, supra, n. 13, at 1684-1686; Posner, supra, n. 13, at 295-296; Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 270-271; but see Louis, supra, n. 13, at 276 n. 6. We quite agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S dissenting comment in Schwinn that &quot;">
<quote local_id="1132" start="63390" end="63695" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 392.

We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning's interpretation of Schwinn. In his dissent below he argued that the decision reflects the view that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of independent businessmen even though they have no impact on &quot;">
<quote local_id="1133" start="63746" end="63869" string="&quot; 537 F. 2d, at 1019. This view is certainly not explicit in Schwinn, which purports to be based on an examination of the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1134" start="63919" end="64223" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 374. Competitive economies have social and political as well as economic advantages, see c. g., Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S., at 4, but an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective bench-marks. As Mr. Justice Brandeis reminded us: &quot;">
<quote local_id="1135" start="64342" end="64681" string="&quot; Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U. S., at 238. Although MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S opinion endorses Judge Browning's interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to distinguish Schwinn on grounds inconsistent with that interpretation, post, at 71.
[22]  In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more complete prohibition &quot;">
<quote local_id="1136" start="64841" end="65583" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 380. The Court also broadly hinted that it would recognize additional exceptions to the per se rule for new entrants in an industry and for failing firms, both of which were mentioned in White Motor as candidates for such exceptions. 388 U. S., at 374. The Court might have limited the exceptions to the per se rule to these situations, which present the strongest arguments for the sacrifice of intrabrand competition for interbrand competition. Significantly, it chose instead to create the more extensive exception for nonsale transactions which is available to all businesses, regardless of their size, financial health, or market share. This broader exception demonstrates even more clearly the Court's awareness of the &quot;">
<quote local_id="1137" start="65600" end="66595" string="&quot; of vertical restrictions.
[23]  Marketing efficiency is not the only legitimate reason for a manufacturer's desire to exert control over the manner in which his products are sold and serviced. As a result of statutory and common-law developments, society increasingly demands that manufacturers assume direct responsibility for the safety and quality of their products. For example, at the federal level, apart from more specialized requirements, manufacturers of consumer products have safety responsibilities under the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 2051 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V), and obligations for warranties under the Consumer Product Warranties Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 2301 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V). Similar obligations are imposed by state law. See, e. g., Cal. Civ. Code Ann. ยง 1790 et seq. (West 1973). The legitimacy of these concerns has been recognized in cases involving vertical restrictions. See, e. g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970).
[24]  &quot;">
<quote local_id="1138" start="66791" end="66991" string="&quot; Note, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 636, 641 (1975). In this context, a manufacturer is likely to view the difference between the price at which it sells to its retailers and their price to the consumer as its &quot;">
<quote local_id="1139" start="67012" end="68335" string="&quot; which it would prefer to minimize. Posner, supra, n. 13, at 283.
[25]  Professor Comanor argues that the promotional activities encouraged by vertical restrictions result in product differentiation and, therefore, a decrease in interbrand competition. This argument is flawed by its necessary assumption that a large part of the promotional efforts resulting from vertical restrictions will not convey socially desirable information about product availability, price, quality, and services. Nor is it clear that a per se rule would result in anything more than a shift to less efficient methods of obtaining the same promotional effects.
[26]  We also note that per se rules in this area may work to the ultimate detriment of the small businessmen who operate as franchisees. To the extent that a per se rule prevents a firm from using the franchise system to achieve efficiencies that it perceives as important to its successful operation, the rule creates an incentive for vertical integration into the distribution system, thereby eliminating to that extent the role of independent businessmen. See, e. g., Keck, The Schwinn Case, 23 Bus. Law. 669 (1968); Pollock, supra, n. 13, at 608-610.
[27]  Continental's contention that balancing intrabrand and interbrand competitive effects of vertical restrictions is not a &quot;">
<quote local_id="1140" start="68372" end="70176" string="&quot; Brief for Petitioners 52, is refuted by Schwinn itself. United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S., at 608, is not to the contrary, for it involved a horizontal restriction among ostensible competitors.
[28]  There may be occasional problems in differentiating vertical restrictions from horizontal restrictions originating in agreements among the retailers. There is no doubt that restrictions in the latter category would be illegal per se, see, e. g., United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 (1966); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, but we do not regard the problems of proof as sufficiently great to justify a per se rule.
[29]  The location restriction used by Sylvania was neither the least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have used. See ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 20-25. But we agree with the implicit judgment in Schwinn that a per se rule based on the nature of the restriction is, in general, undesirable. Although distinctions can be drawn among the frequently used restrictions, we are inclined to view them as differences of degree and form. See Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 279-280; Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and Sherman One: An Analysis and Prognosis, 15 N. Y. L. F. 39, 65 (1969). We are unable to perceive significant social gain from channeling transactions into one form or another. Finally, we agree with the Court in Schwinn that the advantages of vertical restrictions should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms. Sylvania was faltering, if not failing, and we think it would be unduly artificial to deny it the use of valuable competitive tools.
[30]  The importance of stare decisis is, of course, unquestioned, but as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119 (1940), &quot;">
<quote local_id="1141" start="70454" end="70905" string="&quot;
[1]  The franchised retailers would be prevented from engaging in discounting themselves if, under the Colgate doctrine, see infra, at 67, the manufacturer could lawfully terminate dealers who did not adhere to his suggested retail price.
[2]  Given the Government's emphasis on the inhibiting effect of the Schwinn restrictions on discounting activities, the Court may well have been referring to this effect when it condemned the restrictions as &quot;">
<quote local_id="1142" start="70942" end="71372" string="&quot; 388 U. S., at 379. But the Court was also heavily influenced by its concern for the freedom of dealers to control the disposition of products they purchased from Schwinn. See infra, at 66-69. In any event, the record in Schwinn illustrates the potentially greater threat to intrabrand competition posed by customer as opposed to location restrictions.
[3]  Relying on the finding of the District Court, the Government argued:

&quot;">

[5]  Schwinn's national market share declined to 12.8% in the 10 years following the institution of its distribution program, at which time it ranked second behind a firm with a 22.8% share. 388 U. S., at 368-369. In the three years following the adoption of its locations practice, Sylvania's national market share increased to 5%, placing it eighth among manufacturers of color television sets. Ante, at 38-39. At this time Sylvania's shares of the San Francisco, Sacramento, and northern California markets were respectively 2.5%, 15%, and 5%. Ante, at 39 nn. 4, 6. The District Court made no findings as to Schwinn's share of local bicycle markets.

The majority's failure to use the market share of Schwinn and Sylvania as a basis for distinguishing these cases is the more anomalous for its reliance, see infra, at 68-70, on the economic analysis of those who distinguish the anticompetitive effects of distribution restraints on the basis of the market shares of the distributors.

[10]  Professor Posner writes, for example:

&quot;">
<quote local_id="1146" start="74684" end="75071" string="&quot;[If helping new entrants break into a market] is a good justification for exclusive territories, it is an equally good justification for resale price maintenance, which as we have seen is simply another method of dealing with the free-rider problem. . . . In fact, any argument that can be made on behalf of exclusive territories can also be made on behalf of resale price maintenance.&quot;">
