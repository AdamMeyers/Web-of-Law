KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–610.     Argued October 6, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nThe collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent\n  local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employ\n  ees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay\n  the local a “service fee” equal to the portion of union dues related to\n  ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or con\n  tract administration activities. That fee does not include noncharge\n  able union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying ac\n  tivities. The fee includes a charge that represents the “affiliation fee”\n  the local pays to the national union. But, it covers only the part of\n  the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the national’s own chargeable\n  activities, which include some litigation activities that directly bene\n  fit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.\n  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming,\n  inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any\n  portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not di\n  rectly benefit the local, i.e., “national litigation.” The District Court\n  found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.\n  The First Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Under this Court’s precedent, the First Amendment permits a\n local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as\n long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind\n that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation\n appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political ac\n tivities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contribut\n ing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the\n national’s resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of\n the contributing local if and when it takes place. Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) Prior decisions frame the question at issue. The Court has long\n\f2                           LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as\n    the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to\n    charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their\n    continued employment. With respect to litigation expenses, the\n    Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of\n    litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, includ\n    ing litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language\n    that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses “not\n    having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be\n    charged to objecting employees.” Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.\n    435, 453. Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a\n    local’s payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local “may\n    charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs asso\n    ciated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\n    affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct\n    benefit of the objecting employees’ bargaining unit.” Lehnert v. Ferris\n    Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524. The Court added that the local\n    unit need not “demonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the\n    dissenting employee’s unit,” although there must be “some indication\n    that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ulti\n    mately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by vir\n    tue of their membership in the parent organization.” Ibid. However,\n    the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the sub\n    ject here at issue, payment for national litigation. Pp. 4–9.\n       (b) Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability\n    of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain\n    about the matter. Having examined the question further, however,\n    the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of\n    such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the rele\n    vant standards for charging other national expenditures that the\n    Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards, a local may\n    charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a na\n    tional’s litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national\n    litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and\n    (2) the arrangement is reciprocal—that is, the local’s payment to the\n    national affiliate is for “services that may ultimately inure to the\n    benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their member\n    ship in the parent organization.” 500 U. S., at 524. Logic suggests\n    that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses\n    as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant\n    difference between litigation activities and other national activities,\n    the cost of which this Court has found chargeable. The petitioners’\n    arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understand\n    ing of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp. 9–11.\n\f                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n     (c) Applying Lehnert’s standard to the national litigation expenses\n  at issue demonstrates that they are both appropriately related to col\n  lective bargaining activities and reciprocal, and are therefore charge\n  able. First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation\n  activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those\n  aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other\n  matters that the courts have held chargeable. No one here denies\n  that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation\n  to collective bargaining. See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519. Second, al\n  though the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or ex\n  traunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are\n  for services that may ultimately inure to local members’ benefit by\n  virtue of their membership in the national union. Ibid. Respondent\n  local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general\n  access to the national’s financial resources—compiled via contribu\n  tions from various locals—which would not otherwise be available to\n  the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce\n  the local’s collective-bargaining agreements. Because no one claims\n  that the national would treat respondent local any differently from\n  other locals in this regard, the existence of reciprocity is not in dis\n  pute.

LOCKE, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. EDWARD\n     A. KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 21, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The State of Maine requires government employees to\npay a service fee to the local union that acts as their exclu\nsive bargaining agent even if those employees disagree\nwith, and do not belong to, the union. This Court has held\nthat, in principle, the government may require this kind of\npayment without violating the First Amendment. See,\ne.g., Railway Employes v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225 (1956)\n(upholding such an arrangement as constitutional); Abood\nv. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977) (same); Lehnert\nv. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991) (same). At\nthe same time, the Court has considered the constitution\nality of charging for various elements of such a fee, up\nholding the charging of some elements (e.g., those related\nto administering a collective-bargaining contract) while\nforbidding the charging of other elements (e.g., those\nrelated to political expenditures). Compare, e.g., Ellis v.\nRailway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435 (1984), with Machinists v.\nStreet, 367 U. S. 740 (1961).\n   In this case, a local union charges nonmembers a service\nfee that (among other things) reflects an affiliation fee\n\f2                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the local union pays to its national union organiza\ntion. We focus upon one portion of that fee, a portion that\nthe national union uses to pay for litigation expenses\nincurred in large part on behalf of other local units. We\nask whether a local’s charge to nonmembers that reflects\nthat element is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd we conclude that under our precedent the Constitu\ntion permits including this element in the local’s charge to\nnonmembers as long as (1) the subject matter of the (ex\ntra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if\nthe litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately\nrelated to collective bargaining rather than political activi\nties, and (2) the litigation charge is reciprocal in nature,\ni.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals\nto contribute similarly to the national’s resources used for\ncosts of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing\nlocal if and when it takes place.\n                              I\n   Maine has designated the Maine State Employees\nAssociation (the local union) as the exclusive bargaining\nagent for certain executive branch employees. A collec\ntive-bargaining agreement between Maine and the local\nrequires nonmember employees whom the union repre\nsents to pay the local union a “service fee.” And that\nservice fee equals that portion of ordinary union dues that\nis related to ordinary representational activities, e.g.,\ncollective bargaining or contract administration activities.\nIn calculating the fee, the union starts with ordinary\nunion dues and subtracts a sum representing the pro rata\ncost of nonchargeable union activities such as political,\npublic relations, or lobbying activities.\n   The service fee includes a charge that represents the\naffiliation fee the local pays to its national union, the\nService Employees International Union. The included\ncharge takes account of the affiliation fee, however, only\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninsofar as the fee helps to pay for the national’s activities\nthat are of a chargeable kind, such as collective-bargaining\nor contract administration activities. The local does not\ncharge nonmembers for the portion of the affiliation fee\nthat helps pay for the national’s activities of a kind that\nwould not normally be chargeable, such as political, public\nrelations, or lobbying activities.\n   The local includes in the chargeable portion of the\naffiliation fee an amount that helps the national pay for\nlitigation activities, some of which do not directly benefit\nMaine’s state employees’ local but rather directly benefit\nother locals or the national organization itself. (For pur\nposes of simplicity, we shall call all this extraunit litiga\ntion “national litigation.”) As is true of all other parts of\nthe affiliation fee, the local’s charge to nonmembers re\nflects these national litigation costs only insofar as the\nnational litigation concerns activities that are of a charge\nable kind. The local does not charge nonmembers for the\nportion of national litigation costs that concerns activities\nof a kind that would not normally be chargeable, such as\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities.\n   Numbers may help illustrate the scope of the issue. In\n2005, the full service fee the local charged nonmembers\namounted to about 49% of a member’s ordinary union\ndues. (The petitioners here, beneficiaries of grandfather\ning rules, paid a half fee, amounting to about 24.5% of a\nmember’s fee.) The full fee for employees like the petition\ners would have amounted to about $9.70 per month.\nAbout $1.34 per month of that $9.70 reflected a pro rata\nshare of the portion of the national affiliation fee that the\nlocal believed was chargeable. The portion of the $1.34\nper month affiliation fee charge that represented national\nlitigation costs—the cost here at issue—amounted to\nconsiderably less.\n   Although the amount at issue per nonmember may be\nsmall, nonmembers believed the principle important. And\n\f4                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin December 2005, nonmembers challenged in arbitration\nseveral aspects of the local’s service fee, including the\nelement at issue here. In 2006, the arbitrator found all\naspects of the service fee lawful. Before the arbitrator\nreached his decision, however, the petitioners, who are\nnonmembers of the local union, brought this lawsuit in\nMaine’s Federal District Court also challenging various\naspects of the service fee, including this element. In par\nticular, they claimed that the First Amendment prohibits\ncharging them for any portion of the service fee that\nrepresents what we have called “national litigation,” i.e.,\nlitigation that does not directly benefit the local. The\nDistrict Court, finding no material facts at issue, upheld\nthis element of the fee. 425 F. Supp. 2d 137 (2006). The\nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s determination. 498 F. 3d 49 (2007). Because of\nuncertainty among the Circuits as to whether, or when,\nthe Constitution permits charging nonmembers for the\ncosts of national litigation, we granted certiorari. Com\npare Otto v. Pennsylvania State Educ. Assn.-NEA, 330 F.\n3d 125 (CA3 2003), with Pilots Against Illegal Dues v. Air\nLine Pilots Assn., 938 F. 2d 1123 (CA10 1991).\n                              II\n  Prior decisions of this Court frame the question before\nus. In Hanson, Street, and Abood, the Court set forth a\ngeneral First Amendment principle: The First Amendment\npermits the government to require both public sector and\nprivate sector employees who do not wish to join a union\ndesignated as the exclusive collective-bargaining represen\ntative at their unit of employment to pay that union a\nservice fee as a condition of their continued employment.\nTaken together, Hanson and Street make clear that the\nlocal union cannot charge the nonmember for certain\nactivities, such as political or ideological activities (with\nwhich the nonmembers may disagree). But under that\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the local can charge nonmembers for activities\nmore directly related to collective bargaining. In such\ninstances, the Court has determined that the First\nAmendment burdens accompanying the payment require\nment are justified by the government’s interest in prevent\ning freeriding by nonmembers who benefit from the un\nion’s collective-bargaining activities and in maintaining\npeaceful labor relations. Street, 367 U. S., at 768–772;\nHanson, 351 U. S., at 233–238.\n   In Abood, the Court explained the basis for a First\nAmendment challenge to service fees as follows: “To be\nrequired to help finance the union as a collective\nbargaining agent might well be thought . . . to interfere in\nsome way with an employee’s freedom to associate for the\nadvancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he\nsees fit.” 431 U. S., at 222. But the Abood Court rejected\nsuch a challenge. It found that, “the judgment clearly\nmade in Hanson and Street is that such interference as\nexists is constitutionally justified by the legislative as\nsessment of the important contribution of the union shop\nto the system of labor relations established by Congress.”\nIbid. The Court added that, “ ‘furtherance of the common\ncause leaves some leeway for the leadership of the group.\nAs long as they act to promote the cause which justified\nbringing the group together, the individual cannot with\ndraw his support merely because he disagrees with the\ngroup’s strategy.’ ” Id., at 223 (quoting Street, supra, at\n778 (Douglas, J., concurring)).\n   In Ellis and Lehnert, the Court refined the general\nFirst Amendment principle. In particular, it refined the\nboundaries of Abood’s constitutional “leeway” by describ\ning the nature of the cost elements that the local, constitu\ntionally speaking, could include, or which the local could\nnot constitutionally include, in the service fee. In 1984,\nthe Court wrote in Ellis that service fees are constitution\nally permissible when they relate to the union’s duties of\n\f6                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“negotiating and administering a collective agreement and\nin adjusting grievances and disputes.” 466 U. S., at 446–\n447 (citing Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U. S. 113, 121\n(1963)). Accordingly, the Court explained, the local union\ncould charge the nonmember for union “expenditures\n[that] are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur\npose of performing the duties of an exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in dealing with the employer on\nlabor-management issues.” 446 U. S., at 448. In doing so,\nthe union could charge nonmembers for “the direct costs of\nnegotiating and administering a collective-bargaining\ncontract” and for “the expenses of activities or undertak\nings normally or reasonably employed to implement or\neffectuate the duties of the union as exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in the bargaining unit.” Ibid.\n   Applying this standard, the Ellis Court examined the\nparticular service fee charges challenged in that case. The\nCourt held that the local union could charge nonmembers\nfor the costs of a national convention, id., at 448–449; for\nthe costs of social activities, id., at 449–450; and for the\ncosts of those portions of publications not devoted to politi\ncal causes, id., at 450–451. Convention expenses are\nchargeable, the Court explained, because, if a local union\nis to function effectively, “it must maintain its corporate or\nassociational existence.” Id., at 448.\n   The Court also held that the local union could charge\nnonmembers for litigation expenses incidental to the local\nunion’s negotiation or administration of a collective\nbargaining agreement, fair representation litigation,\njurisdictional disputes, or other litigation normally con\nducted by an exclusive representative. Id., at 453. But\nthe Court then said (in language that the petitioners here\nemphasize) that “expenses of litigation not having such\nconnection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged\nto objecting employees.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   In 1991, the Court in Lehnert again described when an\n\f                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense is chargeable. The Court said that a chargeable\nexpenditure must bear an appropriate relation to collec\ntive-bargaining activity. 500 U. S., at 519. (Its specific\ndescription of that relation is not at issue here. Compare\nibid., with id., at 557–558 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part)). The Court then\nconsidered one aspect of the matter here before us, the\nchargeability of a local union’s payment to a national\norganization, say, an affiliation fee. The Court assumed\nthat, in any given year, such a payment would primarily\nbenefit other local units or the national organization itself,\nbut it would not necessarily provide a direct benefit to the\ncontributing local. The petitioners in the case (nonmem\nbers of a teacher’s union) argued that the Constitution\nforbids a local union to charge nonmembers for these\nactivities, i.e., for “activities that, though closely related to\ncollective bargaining generally, are not undertaken di\nrectly on behalf of the bargaining unit to which the object\ning employees belong.” Id., at 519.\n   The Court divided five to four on the general affiliation\nfee matter. The majority of the Court rejected the non\nmembers’ claim. The Court noted that it had “never in\nterpreted” the chargeability test “to require a direct rela\ntionship between the expense at issue and some tangible\nbenefit to the dissenters’ bargaining unit.” Id., at 522.\nIndeed, “to require so close a connection would be to ignore\nthe unified-membership structure under which many\nunions, including those here, operate.”            Id., at 523.\nRather, the affiliation relationship is premised on the\n“notion that the parent will bring to bear its often consid\nerable economic, political, and informational resources\nwhen the local is in need of them.” Ibid. And that “part of\na local’s affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of\nresources potentially available to the local is assessed for\nthe bargaining unit’s protection, even if it is not actually\nexpended on that unit in any particular membership\n\f8                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nyear.” Ibid.\n   The Court then held that “a local bargaining represen\ntative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata\nshare of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable\nactivities of its state and national affiliates, even if those\nactivities were not performed for the direct benefit of the\nobjecting employees’ bargaining unit.” Id., at 524 (empha\nsis added). Of particular relevance here, the Court added\nthat the local unit need not “demonstrate a direct and\ntangible impact upon the dissenting employee’s unit.”\nNonetheless, it said, there must be “some indication that\nthe payment [say, to the national affiliate] is for services\nthat may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of\nthe local union by virtue of their membership in the par\nent organization.” Ibid.\n   Finally, the Lehnert Court turned to the subject now\nbefore us, that of payment for national litigation. On this\npoint, the Court split into three irreconcilable factions. A\nplurality of four wrote that, even though the union was\n“clearly correct that precedent established through litiga\ntion on behalf of one unit may ultimately be of some use to\nanother unit,” it nonetheless found “extraunit litigation to\nbe more akin to lobbying in both kind and effect.” Id., at\n528. The plurality added that litigation is often “expres\nsive.” It concluded that “[w]hen unrelated to an objecting\nemployee’s unit, such activities are not germane to the\nunion’s duties as exclusive bargaining representative.”\nIbid.\n   The Member of the Court who provided the fifth vote for\nthe other portions of the Court’s opinion dissented from\nthe part of the opinion on national litigation. Justice\nMarshall noted that the plurality’s discussion of national\nlitigation costs was dicta because no such costs were at\nissue in the case. Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). Nevertheless, Justice Marshall\ncharacterized any rule that found national litigation costs\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nper se nonchargeable as “surely incorrect” and indicated\nsuch costs should be assessed under the plurality’s own\ntest, i.e., whether the litigation bears an appropriate\nrelation to collective bargaining. Id., at 546–547.\n  At the same time, four Members of the Court agreed\nwith the nonmembers that including national costs in the\nservice fee violates the First Amendment except when\nthose costs pay for specific services “actually provided” to\nthe local. Id., at 561 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). They thought that a local\nunion cannot charge nonmembers for national activities\nunless there is a direct relationship between the expenses\nand “some tangible benefit to the dissenters’ bargaining\nunit.” Id., at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, the dissent expressly rejected the majority’s\nchargeability test for national expenses. But the dissent\ndid not separately discuss national litigation activities,\nperhaps because, as Justice Marshall pointed out, they\nwere not directly at issue in that case.\n                              III\n   As a result of the Lehnert Court’s failure to find a ma\njority as to the chargeability of national litigation ex\npenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the\nmatter. Compare Otto, 330 F. 3d, at 138, with Pilots\nAgainst Illegal Dues, 938 F. 2d, at 1130–1131. Having\nexamined the question further, we now believe that, con\nsistent with the Court’s precedent, costs of that litigation\nare chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant\nstandards for charging other national expenditures that\nthe Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards,\na local union may charge a nonmember an appropriate\nshare of its contribution to a national’s litigation expenses\nif (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an\nappropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the\narrangement is reciprocal—that is, the local’s payment to\n\f10                    LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe national affiliate is for “services that may ultimately\ninure to the benefit of the members of the local union by\nvirtue of their membership in the parent organization.”\n500 U. S., at 524.\n   We reach this conclusion in part because logic suggests\nthat the same standard should apply to national litigation\nexpenses as to other national expenses. We can find no\nsignificant difference between litigation activities and\nother national activities the cost of which this Court has\nfound chargeable. We can find no sound basis for holding\nthat national social activities, national convention activi\nties, and activities involved in producing the nonpolitical\nportions of national union publications all are chargeable\nbut national litigation activities are not. See Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 448–451. Of course, a local nonmember pre\nsumably has the right to attend, and consequently can\ndirectly benefit from, national social and convention ac\ntivities; and a local nonmember can read, and benefit\nfrom, a national publication. But so can a local nonmem\nber benefit from national litigation aimed at helping other\nunits if the national or those other units will similarly\ncontribute to the cost of litigation on the local union’s\nbehalf should the need arise.\n   The petitioners’ arguments to the contrary rest primar\nily upon their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert. Ellis,\nwe must concede, sets forth certain kinds of national\nlitigation—for the most part directly related to a local\nunion’s particular interests—as chargeable; but it then\ngoes on to say, as we have earlier pointed out, ante, at 6–7,\nthat “expenses of litigation not having such a connection\nwith the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting\nemployees.” 466 U. S., at 453. Nonetheless, as the Court\nof Appeals noted, the Ellis Court focused upon a local\nunion’s payment of national litigation expenses without\nany understanding as to reciprocity. Indeed, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY pointed out in his Lehnert dissent, “Ellis . . .\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontains no discussion of whether a bargaining unit might\nchoose to fund litigation . . . through a cost sharing ar\nrangement under the auspices of the affiliate.” 500 U. S.,\nat 564 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part). Ellis nowhere explains why reciprocal\nlitigation funding arrangements would fail to benefit a\nlocal union. Hence, Ellis does not answer the question\npresented here.\n   We must also concede that a plurality in Lehnert wrote\nthat national litigation expenses were not chargeable\n“[w]hen unrelated to an objecting employee’s unit.” 500\nU. S., at 528. But, again, reciprocal litigation funding was\nnot before the Court; hence the plurality could not (and\ndid not) decide whether an understanding as to reciprocity\nproduced the relationship necessary for chargeability.\nRegardless, a plurality does not speak for the Court as a\nwhole.\n   Nor can one simply add together the four Lehnert dis\nsenters and the four Members of the plurality in an effort\nto find a majority of Justices who hold the petitioners’\nview. That is because the Lehnert majority, speaking for\nthe Court, adopted a more liberal standard of charge\nability than the standard embraced by the dissent. And\nthe question here is whether that standard permits charg\ning nonmembers for national litigation expenses. There\nwas no majority agreement in Lehnert about the answer to\nthis last mentioned question. The best we can do for the\npetitioners is to find Lehnert ambiguous on the point at\nissue.\n                             IV\n   Applying Lehnert’s standard to the national litigation\nexpenses here at issue, we find them chargeable. First,\nthe kind of national litigation activity for which the local\ncharges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collec\ntive bargaining, contract administration, or other matters\n\f12                   LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the courts have held chargeable. Ellis, supra, at 446–\n447. The lower courts found (and the petitioners here do\nnot dispute) that the local charges nonmembers only for\nthose national litigation activities that, in respect to sub\nject matter, “were comparable to those undertaken” by the\nlocal and which the local “deemed chargeable” in its calcu\nlation of the “service fee.” 498 F. 3d, at 52, 64–65. And no\none here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity\nbears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.\nSee, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 519; see also id., at 524\n(“[A] local bargaining representative may charge objecting\nemployees for their pro rata share of costs associated with\notherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\naffiliates . . . ”).\n   Second, the location of the litigation activity is at the\nnational (or extraunit), not the local, level. But, as we\nhave just said (under Lehnert), activity at the national\nlevel is chargeable as long as the charges in question are\n“for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of\nthe members of the local union by virtue of their member\nship in the parent organization.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals treated the litigation charge at\nissue as reciprocal in nature, and concluded the District\nCourt must have done so as well. See 498 F. 3d, at 64–65.\nThe local union here says that the payment of its affilia\ntion fee gives locals in general access to the national’s\nfinancial resources—compiled via contributions from\nvarious locals—“which would not otherwise be available to\nthe local union when needed to effectively negotiate, ad\nminister or enforce the local’s collective bargaining agree\nments.” Brief for Respondents 18–19. The resources in\nquestion include resources related to litigation. No one\nclaims that the national would treat the local union before\nus any differently, in terms of making these resources\navailable, than the national would treat any other local.\nThe petitioners do not suggest the contrary. And we\n\f                  Cite as: 555 U.

Consequently, con\nsistent with our precedent, those expenses are chargeable.\nThe similar determination of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 555 U.

Petitioners have\ntaken an all-or-nothing position, contending that non\nmembers of a local may never be assessed for any portion\nof the national’s extraunit litigation expenses. See ante, at\n4 (noting that petitioners “claimed that the First Amend\nment prohibits charging them for any portion of the ser\nvice fee that represents what we have called ‘national\nlitigation,’ i.e., litigation that does not directly benefit the\nlocal” (emphasis added)). The opinion correctly concludes,\n“as did the lower courts, that the existence of reciprocity is\nassumed by the parties and not here in dispute.” Ante, at\n13.\n   Thus, this case does not require us to address what is\nmeant by a charge being “reciprocal in nature,” or what\nshowing is required to establish that services “ ‘may ulti\nmately inure to the benefit of the members of the local\nunion by virtue of their membership in the parent organi\nzation.’ ” Ante, at 12 (citing Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty\nAssn., 500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991)). I understand the Court’s\nopinion to conclude that the litigation expenses at issue\nhere are chargeable only because the parties assumed that\n\f2                     LOCKE v.

Once nonmembers\nobject to a charge, the Government submits, the union\nmust prove that the challenged expenditure was made\npursuant to an arrangement that is akin to an insurance\npolicy. See id., at 7. This is necessary, the Government\ncontends, to ensure that a charge is in fact “reciprocal in\nnature.”\n   Because important First Amendment rights are at\nstake, the Government’s argument regarding the burden\nof establishing true reciprocity has considerable force.\nNonetheless, since petitioners in this case did not raise the\nquestion whether the Maine State Employees Associa\ntion’s pooling arrangement was bona fide, we need not\nreach that question today.\n\f", "absolute_url": "/opinion/145919/locke-v-karass/", "author": null, "html": "", "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145919/", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 6, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nThe collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent\n  local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employ\n  ees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay\n  the local a “service fee” equal to the portion of union dues related to\n  ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or con\n  tract administration activities. That fee does not include noncharge\n  able union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying ac\n  tivities. The fee includes a charge that represents the “affiliation fee”\n  the local pays to the national union. But, it covers only the part of\n  the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the national’s own chargeable\n  activities, which include some litigation activities that directly bene\n  fit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.\n  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming,\n  inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any\n  portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not di\n  rectly benefit the local, i.e., “national litigation.” The District Court\n  found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.\n  The First Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Under this Court’s precedent, the First Amendment permits a\n local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as\n long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind\n that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation\n appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political ac\n tivities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contribut\n ing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the\n national’s resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of\n the contributing local if and when it takes place. Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) Prior decisions frame the question at issue. The Court has long\n\f2                           LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as\n    the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to\n    charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their\n    continued employment. With respect to litigation expenses, the\n    Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of\n    litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, includ\n    ing litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language\n    that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses “not\n    having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be\n    charged to objecting employees.” Ellis v. Railway Clerks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111161\"><a href=\"/opinion/111161/ellis-v-railway-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n    <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453. Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a\n    local’s payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local “may\n    charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs asso\n    ciated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\n    affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct\n    benefit of the objecting employees’ bargaining unit.” Lehnert v. Ferris\n    Faculty Assn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112607\"><a href=\"/opinion/112607/lehnert-v-ferris-faculty-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524. The Court added that the local\n    unit need not “demonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the\n    dissenting employee’s unit,” although there must be “some indication\n    that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ulti\n    mately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by vir\n    tue of their membership in the parent organization.” Ibid. However,\n    the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the sub\n    ject here at issue, payment for national litigation. Pp. 4–9.\n       (b) Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability\n    of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain\n    about the matter. Having examined the question further, however,\n    the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of\n    such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the rele\n    vant standards for charging other national expenditures that the\n    Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards, a local may\n    charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a na\n    tional’s litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national\n    litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and\n    (2) the arrangement is reciprocal—that is, the local’s payment to the\n    national affiliate is for “services that may ultimately inure to the\n    benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their member\n    ship in the parent organization.” 500 U. S., at 524. Logic suggests\n    that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses\n    as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant\n    difference between litigation activities and other national activities,\n    the cost of which this Court has found chargeable. The petitioners’\n    arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understand\n    ing of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp. 9–11.\n\f                      Cite as: 555 U.

First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation\n  activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those\n  aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other\n  matters that the courts have held chargeable. No one here denies\n  that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation\n  to collective bargaining. See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519. Second, al\n  though the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or ex\n  traunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are\n  for services that may ultimately inure to local members’ benefit by\n  virtue of their membership in the national union. Ibid. Respondent\n  local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general\n  access to the national’s financial resources—compiled via contribu\n  tions from various locals—which would not otherwise be available to\n  the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce\n  the local’s collective-bargaining agreements. Because no one claims\n  that the national would treat respondent local any differently from\n  other locals in this regard, the existence of reciprocity is not in dis\n  pute.

KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the local union pays to its national union organiza\ntion. We focus upon one portion of that fee, a portion that\nthe national union uses to pay for litigation expenses\nincurred in large part on behalf of other local units. We\nask whether a local’s charge to nonmembers that reflects\nthat element is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd we conclude that under our precedent the Constitu\ntion permits including this element in the local’s charge to\nnonmembers as long as (1) the subject matter of the (ex\ntra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if\nthe litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately\nrelated to collective bargaining rather than political activi\nties, and (2) the litigation charge is reciprocal in nature,\ni.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals\nto contribute similarly to the national’s resources used for\ncosts of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing\nlocal if and when it takes place.\n                              I\n   Maine has designated the Maine State Employees\nAssociation (the local union) as the exclusive bargaining\nagent for certain executive branch employees. A collec\ntive-bargaining agreement between Maine and the local\nrequires nonmember employees whom the union repre\nsents to pay the local union a “service fee.” And that\nservice fee equals that portion of ordinary union dues that\nis related to ordinary representational activities, e.g.,\ncollective bargaining or contract administration activities.\nIn calculating the fee, the union starts with ordinary\nunion dues and subtracts a sum representing the pro rata\ncost of nonchargeable union activities such as political,\npublic relations, or lobbying activities.\n   The service fee includes a charge that represents the\naffiliation fee the local pays to its national union, the\nService Employees International Union. The included\ncharge takes account of the affiliation fee, however, only\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninsofar as the fee helps to pay for the national’s activities\nthat are of a chargeable kind, such as collective-bargaining\nor contract administration activities. The local does not\ncharge nonmembers for the portion of the affiliation fee\nthat helps pay for the national’s activities of a kind that\nwould not normally be chargeable, such as political, public\nrelations, or lobbying activities.\n   The local includes in the chargeable portion of the\naffiliation fee an amount that helps the national pay for\nlitigation activities, some of which do not directly benefit\nMaine’s state employees’ local but rather directly benefit\nother locals or the national organization itself. (For pur\nposes of simplicity, we shall call all this extraunit litiga\ntion “national litigation.”) As is true of all other parts of\nthe affiliation fee, the local’s charge to nonmembers re\nflects these national litigation costs only insofar as the\nnational litigation concerns activities that are of a charge\nable kind. The local does not charge nonmembers for the\nportion of national litigation costs that concerns activities\nof a kind that would not normally be chargeable, such as\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities.\n   Numbers may help illustrate the scope of the issue. In\n2005, the full service fee the local charged nonmembers\namounted to about 49% of a member’s ordinary union\ndues. (The petitioners here, beneficiaries of grandfather\ning rules, paid a half fee, amounting to about 24.5% of a\nmember’s fee.) The full fee for employees like the petition\ners would have amounted to about $9.70 per month.\nAbout $1.34 per month of that $9.70 reflected a pro rata\nshare of the portion of the national affiliation fee that the\nlocal believed was chargeable. The portion of the $1.34\nper month affiliation fee charge that represented national\nlitigation costs—the cost here at issue—amounted to\nconsiderably less.\n   Although the amount at issue per nonmember may be\nsmall, nonmembers believed the principle important.

In 2006, the arbitrator found all\naspects of the service fee lawful. Before the arbitrator\nreached his decision, however, the petitioners, who are\nnonmembers of the local union, brought this lawsuit in\nMaine’s Federal District Court also challenging various\naspects of the service fee, including this element. In par\nticular, they claimed that the First Amendment prohibits\ncharging them for any portion of the service fee that\nrepresents what we have called “national litigation,” i.e.,\nlitigation that does not directly benefit the local. The\nDistrict Court, finding no material facts at issue, upheld\nthis element of the fee. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2481467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2481467/locke-v-karass/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Hanson, Street, and Abood, the Court set forth a\ngeneral First Amendment principle: The First Amendment\npermits the government to require both public sector and\nprivate sector employees who do not wish to join a union\ndesignated as the exclusive collective-bargaining represen\ntative at their unit of employment to pay that union a\nservice fee as a condition of their continued employment.\nTaken together, Hanson and Street make clear that the\nlocal union cannot charge the nonmember for certain\nactivities, such as political or ideological activities (with\nwhich the nonmembers may disagree). But under that\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the local can charge nonmembers for activities\nmore directly related to collective bargaining. In such\ninstances, the Court has determined that the First\nAmendment burdens accompanying the payment require\nment are justified by the government’s interest in prevent\ning freeriding by nonmembers who benefit from the un\nion’s collective-bargaining activities and in maintaining\npeaceful labor relations. Street, 367 U. S., at 768–772;\nHanson, 351 U. S., at 233–238.\n   In Abood, the Court explained the basis for a First\nAmendment challenge to service fees as follows: “To be\nrequired to help finance the union as a collective\nbargaining agent might well be thought . . . to interfere in\nsome way with an employee’s freedom to associate for the\nadvancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he\nsees fit.” 431 U. S., at 222. But the Abood Court rejected\nsuch a challenge. It found that, “the judgment clearly\nmade in Hanson and Street is that such interference as\nexists is constitutionally justified by the legislative as\nsessment of the important contribution of the union shop\nto the system of labor relations established by Congress.”\nIbid. The Court added that, “ ‘furtherance of the common\ncause leaves some leeway for the leadership of the group.\nAs long as they act to promote the cause which justified\nbringing the group together, the individual cannot with\ndraw his support merely because he disagrees with the\ngroup’s strategy.’ ” Id., at 223 (quoting Street, supra, at\n778 (Douglas, J., concurring)).\n   In Ellis and Lehnert, the Court refined the general\nFirst Amendment principle. In particular, it refined the\nboundaries of Abood’s constitutional “leeway” by describ\ning the nature of the cost elements that the local, constitu\ntionally speaking, could include, or which the local could\nnot constitutionally include, in the service fee. In 1984,\nthe Court wrote in Ellis that service fees are constitution\nally permissible when they relate to the union’s duties of\n\f6                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“negotiating and administering a collective agreement and\nin adjusting grievances and disputes.” 466 U. S., at 446–\n447 (citing Railway Clerks v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106600\"><a href=\"/opinion/106600/railway-clerks-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121\n(1963)). Accordingly, the Court explained, the local union\ncould charge the nonmember for union “expenditures\n[that] are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur\npose of performing the duties of an exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in dealing with the employer on\nlabor-management issues.” 446 U. S., at 448. In doing so,\nthe union could charge nonmembers for “the direct costs of\nnegotiating and administering a collective-bargaining\ncontract” and for “the expenses of activities or undertak\nings normally or reasonably employed to implement or\neffectuate the duties of the union as exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in the bargaining unit.” Ibid.\n   Applying this standard, the Ellis Court examined the\nparticular service fee charges challenged in that case. The\nCourt held that the local union could charge nonmembers\nfor the costs of a national convention, id., at 448–449; for\nthe costs of social activities, id., at 449–450; and for the\ncosts of those portions of publications not devoted to politi\ncal causes, id., at 450–451. Convention expenses are\nchargeable, the Court explained, because, if a local union\nis to function effectively, “it must maintain its corporate or\nassociational existence.” Id., at 448.\n   The Court also held that the local union could charge\nnonmembers for litigation expenses incidental to the local\nunion’s negotiation or administration of a collective\nbargaining agreement, fair representation litigation,\njurisdictional disputes, or other litigation normally con\nducted by an exclusive representative. Id., at 453. But\nthe Court then said (in language that the petitioners here\nemphasize) that “expenses of litigation not having such\nconnection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged\nto objecting employees.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   In 1991, the Court in Lehnert again described when an\n\f                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense is chargeable. The Court said that a chargeable\nexpenditure must bear an appropriate relation to collec\ntive-bargaining activity. 500 U. S., at 519. (Its specific\ndescription of that relation is not at issue here. Compare\nibid., with id., at 557–558 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part)). The Court then\nconsidered one aspect of the matter here before us, the\nchargeability of a local union’s payment to a national\norganization, say, an affiliation fee. The Court assumed\nthat, in any given year, such a payment would primarily\nbenefit other local units or the national organization itself,\nbut it would not necessarily provide a direct benefit to the\ncontributing local. The petitioners in the case (nonmem\nbers of a teacher’s union) argued that the Constitution\nforbids a local union to charge nonmembers for these\nactivities, i.e., for “activities that, though closely related to\ncollective bargaining generally, are not undertaken di\nrectly on behalf of the bargaining unit to which the object\ning employees belong.” Id., at 519.\n   The Court divided five to four on the general affiliation\nfee matter. The majority of the Court rejected the non\nmembers’ claim. The Court noted that it had “never in\nterpreted” the chargeability test “to require a direct rela\ntionship between the expense at issue and some tangible\nbenefit to the dissenters’ bargaining unit.” Id., at 522.\nIndeed, “to require so close a connection would be to ignore\nthe unified-membership structure under which many\nunions, including those here, operate.”            Id., at 523.\nRather, the affiliation relationship is premised on the\n“notion that the parent will bring to bear its often consid\nerable economic, political, and informational resources\nwhen the local is in need of them.” Ibid. And that “part of\na local’s affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of\nresources potentially available to the local is assessed for\nthe bargaining unit’s protection, even if it is not actually\nexpended on that unit in any particular membership\n\f8                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nyear.” Ibid.\n   The Court then held that “a local bargaining represen\ntative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata\nshare of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable\nactivities of its state and national affiliates, even if those\nactivities were not performed for the direct benefit of the\nobjecting employees’ bargaining unit.” Id., at 524 (empha\nsis added). Of particular relevance here, the Court added\nthat the local unit need not “demonstrate a direct and\ntangible impact upon the dissenting employee’s unit.”\nNonetheless, it said, there must be “some indication that\nthe payment [say, to the national affiliate] is for services\nthat may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of\nthe local union by virtue of their membership in the par\nent organization.” Ibid.\n   Finally, the Lehnert Court turned to the subject now\nbefore us, that of payment for national litigation. On this\npoint, the Court split into three irreconcilable factions. A\nplurality of four wrote that, even though the union was\n“clearly correct that precedent established through litiga\ntion on behalf of one unit may ultimately be of some use to\nanother unit,” it nonetheless found “extraunit litigation to\nbe more akin to lobbying in both kind and effect.” Id., at\n528. The plurality added that litigation is often “expres\nsive.” It concluded that “[w]hen unrelated to an objecting\nemployee’s unit, such activities are not germane to the\nunion’s duties as exclusive bargaining representative.”\nIbid.\n   The Member of the Court who provided the fifth vote for\nthe other portions of the Court’s opinion dissented from\nthe part of the opinion on national litigation. Justice\nMarshall noted that the plurality’s discussion of national\nlitigation costs was dicta because no such costs were at\nissue in the case. Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). Nevertheless, Justice Marshall\ncharacterized any rule that found national litigation costs\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nper se nonchargeable as “surely incorrect” and indicated\nsuch costs should be assessed under the plurality’s own\ntest, i.e., whether the litigation bears an appropriate\nrelation to collective bargaining. Id., at 546–547.\n  At the same time, four Members of the Court agreed\nwith the nonmembers that including national costs in the\nservice fee violates the First Amendment except when\nthose costs pay for specific services “actually provided” to\nthe local. Id., at 561 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). They thought that a local\nunion cannot charge nonmembers for national activities\nunless there is a direct relationship between the expenses\nand “some tangible benefit to the dissenters’ bargaining\nunit.” Id., at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, the dissent expressly rejected the majority’s\nchargeability test for national expenses. But the dissent\ndid not separately discuss national litigation activities,\nperhaps because, as Justice Marshall pointed out, they\nwere not directly at issue in that case.\n                              III\n   As a result of the Lehnert Court’s failure to find a ma\njority as to the chargeability of national litigation ex\npenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the\nmatter. Compare Otto, 330 F. 3d, at 138, with Pilots\nAgainst Illegal Dues, 938 F. 2d, at 1130–1131. Having\nexamined the question further, we now believe that, con\nsistent with the Court’s precedent, costs of that litigation\nare chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant\nstandards for charging other national expenditures that\nthe Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards,\na local union may charge a nonmember an appropriate\nshare of its contribution to a national’s litigation expenses\nif (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an\nappropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the\narrangement is reciprocal—that is, the local’s payment to\n\f10                    LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe national affiliate is for “services that may ultimately\ninure to the benefit of the members of the local union by\nvirtue of their membership in the parent organization.”\n500 U. S., at 524.\n   We reach this conclusion in part because logic suggests\nthat the same standard should apply to national litigation\nexpenses as to other national expenses. We can find no\nsignificant difference between litigation activities and\nother national activities the cost of which this Court has\nfound chargeable. We can find no sound basis for holding\nthat national social activities, national convention activi\nties, and activities involved in producing the nonpolitical\nportions of national union publications all are chargeable\nbut national litigation activities are not. See Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 448–451. Of course, a local nonmember pre\nsumably has the right to attend, and consequently can\ndirectly benefit from, national social and convention ac\ntivities; and a local nonmember can read, and benefit\nfrom, a national publication. But so can a local nonmem\nber benefit from national litigation aimed at helping other\nunits if the national or those other units will similarly\ncontribute to the cost of litigation on the local union’s\nbehalf should the need arise.\n   The petitioners’ arguments to the contrary rest primar\nily upon their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert. Ellis,\nwe must concede, sets forth certain kinds of national\nlitigation—for the most part directly related to a local\nunion’s particular interests—as chargeable; but it then\ngoes on to say, as we have earlier pointed out, ante, at 6–7,\nthat “expenses of litigation not having such a connection\nwith the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting\nemployees.” 466 U. S., at 453. Nonetheless, as the Court\nof Appeals noted, the Ellis Court focused upon a local\nunion’s payment of national litigation expenses without\nany understanding as to reciprocity. Indeed, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY pointed out in his Lehnert dissent, “Ellis . . .\n\f                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontains no discussion of whether a bargaining unit might\nchoose to fund litigation . . . through a cost sharing ar\nrangement under the auspices of the affiliate.” 500 U. S.,\nat 564 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part). Ellis nowhere explains why reciprocal\nlitigation funding arrangements would fail to benefit a\nlocal union. Hence, Ellis does not answer the question\npresented here.\n   We must also concede that a plurality in Lehnert wrote\nthat national litigation expenses were not chargeable\n“[w]hen unrelated to an objecting employee’s unit.” 500\nU. S., at 528. But, again, reciprocal litigation funding was\nnot before the Court; hence the plurality could not (and\ndid not) decide whether an understanding as to reciprocity\nproduced the relationship necessary for chargeability.\nRegardless, a plurality does not speak for the Court as a\nwhole.\n   Nor can one simply add together the four Lehnert dis\nsenters and the four Members of the plurality in an effort\nto find a majority of Justices who hold the petitioners’\nview. That is because the Lehnert majority, speaking for\nthe Court, adopted a more liberal standard of charge\nability than the standard embraced by the dissent. And\nthe question here is whether that standard permits charg\ning nonmembers for national litigation expenses. There\nwas no majority agreement in Lehnert about the answer to\nthis last mentioned question. The best we can do for the\npetitioners is to find Lehnert ambiguous on the point at\nissue.\n                             IV\n   Applying Lehnert’s standard to the national litigation\nexpenses here at issue, we find them chargeable. First,\nthe kind of national litigation activity for which the local\ncharges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collec\ntive bargaining, contract administration, or other matters\n\f12                   LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the courts have held chargeable. Ellis, supra, at 446–\n447. The lower courts found (and the petitioners here do\nnot dispute) that the local charges nonmembers only for\nthose national litigation activities that, in respect to sub\nject matter, “were comparable to those undertaken” by the\nlocal and which the local “deemed chargeable” in its calcu\nlation of the “service fee.” 498 F. 3d, at 52, 64–65. And no\none here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity\nbears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.\nSee, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 519; see also id., at 524\n(“[A] local bargaining representative may charge objecting\nemployees for their pro rata share of costs associated with\notherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\naffiliates . . . ”).\n   Second, the location of the litigation activity is at the\nnational (or extraunit), not the local, level. But, as we\nhave just said (under Lehnert), activity at the national\nlevel is chargeable as long as the charges in question are\n“for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of\nthe members of the local union by virtue of their member\nship in the parent organization.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals treated the litigation charge at\nissue as reciprocal in nature, and concluded the District\nCourt must have done so as well. See 498 F. 3d, at 64–65.\nThe local union here says that the payment of its affilia\ntion fee gives locals in general access to the national’s\nfinancial resources—compiled via contributions from\nvarious locals—“which would not otherwise be available to\nthe local union when needed to effectively negotiate, ad\nminister or enforce the local’s collective bargaining agree\nments.” Brief for Respondents 18–19. The resources in\nquestion include resources related to litigation. No one\nclaims that the national would treat the local union before\nus any differently, in terms of making these resources\navailable, than the national would treat any other local.\nThe petitioners do not suggest the contrary. And we\n\f                  Cite as: 555 U.

Consequently, con\nsistent with our precedent, those expenses are chargeable.\nThe similar determination of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 555 U.

Petitioners have\ntaken an all-or-nothing position, contending that non\nmembers of a local may never be assessed for any portion\nof the national’s extraunit litigation expenses. See ante, at\n4 (noting that petitioners “claimed that the First Amend\nment prohibits charging them for any portion of the ser\nvice fee that represents what we have called ‘national\nlitigation,’ i.e., litigation that does not directly benefit the\nlocal” (emphasis added)). The opinion correctly concludes,\n“as did the lower courts, that the existence of reciprocity is\nassumed by the parties and not here in dispute.” Ante, at\n13.\n   Thus, this case does not require us to address what is\nmeant by a charge being “reciprocal in nature,” or what\nshowing is required to establish that services “ ‘may ulti\nmately inure to the benefit of the members of the local\nunion by virtue of their membership in the parent organi\nzation.’ ” Ante, at 12 (citing Lehnert v.

Once nonmembers\nobject to a charge, the Government submits, the union\nmust prove that the challenged expenditure was made\npursuant to an arrangement that is akin to an insurance\npolicy. See id., at 7. This is necessary, the Government\ncontends, to ensure that a charge is in fact “reciprocal in\nnature.”\n   Because important First Amendment rights are at\nstake, the Government’s argument regarding the burden\nof establishing true reciprocity has considerable force.\nNonetheless, since petitioners in this case did not raise the\nquestion whether the Maine State Employees Associa\ntion’s pooling arrangement was bona fide, we need not\nreach that question today.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "joined_by": [], "sha1": "a277aaaf94f7bee755656689e831c89b350d769e"}
