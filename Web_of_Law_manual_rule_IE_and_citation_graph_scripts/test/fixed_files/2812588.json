GROSS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 14–7955. Argued April 29, 2015—Decided June 29, 2015\nBecause capital punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitu-\n  tional means of carrying it out. After Oklahoma adopted lethal injec-\n  tion as its method of execution, it settled on a three-drug protocol of\n  (1) sodium thiopental (a barbiturate) to induce a state of uncon-\n  sciousness, (2) a paralytic agent to inhibit all muscular-skeletal\n  movements, and (3) potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest. In\n  Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, the Court held that this protocol does not\n  violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unu-\n  sual punishments. Anti-death-penalty advocates then pressured\n  pharmaceutical companies to prevent sodium thiopental (and, later,\n  another barbiturate called pentobarbital) from being used in execu-\n  tions. Unable to obtain either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital,\n  Oklahoma decided to use a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, a seda-\n  tive, as the first drug in its three-drug protocol.\n     Oklahoma death-row inmates filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 action\n  claiming that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.\n  Four of those inmates filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and\n  argued that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will not render them\n  unable to feel pain associated with administration of the second and\n  third drugs. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court\n  denied the motion. It held that the prisoners failed to identify a\n  known and available alternative method of execution that presented\n  a substantially less severe risk of pain. It also held that the prison-\n  ers failed to establish a likelihood of showing that the use of midazo-\n  lam created a demonstrated risk of severe pain. The Tenth Circuit\n  affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the\n merits of their claim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth\n\f2                           GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Amendment. Pp. 11–29.\n       (a) To obtain a preliminary injunction, petitioners must establish,\n    among other things, a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n    claim. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\n    U. S. 7, 20. To succeed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-\n    execution claim, a prisoner must establish that the method creates a\n    demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the risk is substantial\n    when compared to the known and available alternatives. Baze, su-\n    pra, at 61 (plurality opinion). Pp. 11–13.\n       (b) Petitioners failed to establish that any risk of harm was sub-\n    stantial when compared to a known and available alternative method\n    of execution. Petitioners have suggested that Oklahoma could exe-\n    cute them using sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, but the District\n    Court did not commit a clear error when it found that those drugs are\n    unavailable to the State. Petitioners argue that the Eighth Amend-\n    ment does not require them to identify such an alternative, but their\n    argument is inconsistent with the controlling opinion in Baze, which\n    imposed a requirement that the Court now follows. Petitioners also\n    argue that the requirement to identify an alternative is inconsistent\n    with the Court’s pre-Baze decision in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S.\n    573, but they misread that decision. Hill concerned a question of civ-\n    il procedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment question. That\n    case held that §1983 alone does not require an inmate asserting a\n    method-of-execution claim to plead an acceptable alternative. Baze,\n    on the other hand, made clear that the Eighth Amendment requires a\n    prisoner to plead and prove a known and available alternative.\n    Pp. 13–16.\n       (c) The District Court did not commit clear error when it found that\n    midazolam is likely to render a person unable to feel pain associated\n    with administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.\n    Pp. 16–29.\n          (1) Several initial considerations bear emphasis. First, the Dis-\n    trict Court’s factual findings are reviewed under the deferential\n    “clear error” standard. Second, petitioners have the burden of per-\n    suasion on the question whether midazolam is effective. Third, the\n    fact that numerous courts have concluded that midazolam is likely to\n    render an inmate insensate to pain during execution heightens the\n    deference owed to the District Court’s findings. Finally, challenges to\n    lethal injection protocols test the boundaries of the authority and\n    competency of federal courts, which should not embroil themselves in\n    ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise. Baze, supra,\n    at 51. Pp. 16–18.\n          (2) The State’s expert presented persuasive testimony that a 500-\n    milligram dose of midazolam would make it a virtual certainty that\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  an inmate will not feel pain associated with the second and third\n  drugs, and petitioners’ experts acknowledged that they had no con-\n  trary scientific proof. Expert testimony presented by both sides lends\n  support to the District Court’s conclusion. Evidence suggested that a\n  500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a coma, and even one of\n  petitioners’ experts agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases, it\n  is expected to produce a lack of response to pain. It is not dispositive\n  that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole\n  anesthetic during painful surgery. First, the 500-milligram dose at\n  issue here is many times higher than a normal therapeutic dose.\n  Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for\n  maintaining unconsciousness says little about whether a 500-\n  milligram dose is constitutionally adequate to conduct an execution.\n  Finally, the District Court did not err in concluding that the safe-\n  guards adopted by Oklahoma to ensure proper administration of\n  midazolam serve to minimize any risk that the drug will not operate\n  as intended. Pp. 18–22.\n       (3) Petitioners’ speculative evidence regarding midazolam’s “ceil-\n  ing effect” does not establish that the District Court’s findings were\n  clearly erroneous. The mere fact that midazolam has a ceiling above\n  which an increase in dosage produces no effect cannot be dispositive,\n  and petitioners provided little probative evidence on the relevant\n  question, i.e., whether midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs below the\n  level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does\n  not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by\n  the second and third drugs. Petitioners attempt to deflect attention\n  from their failure of proof on this point by criticizing the testimony of\n  the State’s expert. They emphasize an apparent conflict between the\n  State’s expert and their own expert regarding the biological process\n  that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect. But even if petitioners’ ex-\n  pert is correct regarding that biological process, it is largely beside\n  the point. What matters for present purposes is the dosage at which\n  the ceiling effect kicks in, not the biological process that produces the\n  effect. Pp. 22–25.\n       (4) Petitioners’ remaining arguments—that an expert report pre-\n  sented in the District Court should have been rejected because it ref-\n  erenced unreliable sources and contained an alleged mathematical\n  error, that only four States have used midazolam in an execution,\n  and that difficulties during two recent executions suggest that mid-\n  azolam is ineffective—all lack merit.

GROSS, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                 [June 29, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Prisoners sentenced to death in the State of Oklahoma\nfiled an action in federal court under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983, contending that the method of execution\nnow used by the State violates the Eighth Amendment\nbecause it creates an unacceptable risk of severe pain.\nThey argue that midazolam, the first drug employed in the\nState’s current three-drug protocol, fails to render a per-\nson insensate to pain. After holding an evidentiary hear-\ning, the District Court denied four prisoners’ application\nfor a preliminary injunction, finding that they had failed\nto prove that midazolam is ineffective. The Court of Ap-\npeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed and accepted the\nDistrict Court’s finding of fact regarding midazolam’s\nefficacy.\n   For two independent reasons, we also affirm. First, the\nprisoners failed to identify a known and available alterna-\ntive method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\na requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-\nexecution claims. See Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 61 (2008)\n(plurality opinion). Second, the District Court did not\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncommit clear error when it found that the prisoners failed\nto establish that Oklahoma’s use of a massive dose of\nmidazolam in its execution protocol entails a substantial\nrisk of severe pain.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n    The death penalty was an accepted punishment at the\ntime of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of\nRights. In that era, death sentences were usually carried\nout by hanging. The Death Penalty in America: Current\nControversies 4 (H. Bedau ed. 1997). Hanging remained\nthe standard method of execution through much of the\n19th century, but that began to change in the century’s\nlater years. See Baze, supra, at 41–42. In the 1880’s, the\nLegislature of the State of New York appointed a commis-\nsion to find “ ‘the most humane and practical method\nknown to modern science of carrying into effect the sen-\ntence of death in capital cases.’ ” In re Kemmler, 136 U. S.\n436, 444 (1890). The commission recommended electrocu-\ntion, and in 1888, the Legislature enacted a law providing\nfor this method of execution. Id., at 444–445. In subse-\nquent years, other States followed New York’s lead in the\n“ ‘belief that electrocution is less painful and more humane\nthan hanging.’ ” Baze, 553 U. S., at 42 (quoting Malloy v.\nSouth Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 185 (1915)).\n    In 1921, the Nevada Legislature adopted another new\nmethod of execution, lethal gas, after concluding that this\nwas “the most humane manner known to modern science.”\nState v. Jon, 46 Nev. 418, 437, 211 P. 676, 682 (1923). The\nNevada Supreme Court rejected the argument that the\nuse of lethal gas was unconstitutional, id., at 435–437, 211\nP., at 681–682, and other States followed Nevada’s lead,\nsee, e.g., Ariz. Const., Art. XXII, §22 (1933); 1937 Cal.\nStats. ch. 172, §1; 1933 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, §1; 1955\nMd. Laws ch. 625, §1, p. 1017; 1937 Mo. Laws p. 222, §1.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNevertheless, hanging and the firing squad were retained\nin some States, see, e.g., 1961 Del. Laws ch. 309, §2 (hang-\ning); 1935 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 155, §1 (hanging); Utah\nCode Crim. Proc. §105–37–16 (1933) (hanging or firing\nsquad), and electrocution remained the predominant\nmethod of execution until the 9-year hiatus in executions\nthat ended with our judgment in Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153 (1976). See Baze, supra, at 42.\n  After Gregg reaffirmed that the death penalty does not\nviolate the Constitution, some States once again sought a\nmore humane way to carry out death sentences. They\neventually adopted lethal injection, which today is “by far\nthe most prevalent method of execution in the United\nStates.” Baze, supra, at 42. Oklahoma adopted lethal\ninjection in 1977, see 1977 Okla. Sess. Laws p. 89, and it\neventually settled on a protocol that called for the use of\nthree drugs: (1) sodium thiopental, “a fast-acting barbitu-\nrate sedative that induces a deep, comalike unconscious-\nness when given in the amounts used for lethal injection,”\n(2) a paralytic agent, which “inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respi-\nration,” and (3) potassium chloride, which “interferes with\nthe electrical signals that stimulate the contractions of the\nheart, inducing cardiac arrest.” Baze, supra, at 44; see\nalso Brief for Respondents 9. By 2008, at least 30 of the\n36 States that used lethal injection employed that particu-\nlar three-drug protocol. 553 U. S., at 44.\n  While methods of execution have changed over the\nyears, “[t]his Court has never invalidated a State’s chosen\nprocedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the\ninfliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” Id., at 48. In\nWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 134–135 (1879), the Court\nupheld a sentence of death by firing squad. In In re\nKemmler, supra, at 447–449, the Court rejected a chal-\nlenge to the use of the electric chair. And the Court did\nnot retreat from that holding even when presented with a\n\f4                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase in which a State’s initial attempt to execute a pris-\noner by electrocution was unsuccessful. Louisiana ex rel.\nFrancis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 463–464 (1947) (plu-\nrality opinion). Most recently, in Baze, supra, seven Jus-\ntices agreed that the three-drug protocol just discussed\ndoes not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our decisions in this area have been animated in part\nby the recognition that because it is settled that capital\npunishment is constitutional, “[i]t necessarily follows that\nthere must be a [constitutional] means of carrying it out.”\nId., at 47. And because some risk of pain is inherent in\nany method of execution, we have held that the Constitu-\ntion does not require the avoidance of all risk of pain.\nIbid. After all, while most humans wish to die a painless\ndeath, many do not have that good fortune. Holding that\nthe Eighth Amendment demands the elimination of essen-\ntially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death\npenalty altogether.\n                               B\n   Baze cleared any legal obstacle to use of the most com-\nmon three-drug protocol that had enabled States to carry\nout the death penalty in a quick and painless fashion. But\na practical obstacle soon emerged, as anti-death-penalty\nadvocates pressured pharmaceutical companies to refuse\nto supply the drugs used to carry out death sentences.\nThe sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the\nfirst drug used in the standard three-drug protocol, was\npersuaded to cease production of the drug. After suspend-\ning domestic production in 2009, the company planned to\nresume production in Italy. Koppel, Execution Drug Halt\nRaises Ire of Doctors, Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2011,\np. A6. Activists then pressured both the company and the\nItalian Government to stop the sale of sodium thiopental\nfor use in lethal injections in this country.

That effort proved success-\nful, and in January 2011, the company announced that it\nwould exit the sodium thiopental market entirely. See\nHospira, Press Release, Hospira Statement Regarding\nPentothalTM (sodium thiopental) Market Exit (Jan. 21,\n2011).\n   After other efforts to procure sodium thiopental proved\nunsuccessful, States sought an alternative, and they even-\ntually replaced sodium thiopental with pentobarbital,\nanother barbiturate. In December 2010, Oklahoma be-\ncame the first State to execute an inmate using pentobar-\nbital. See Reuters, Chicago Tribune, New Drug Mix Used\nin Oklahoma Execution, Dec. 17 2010, p. 41. That execu-\ntion occurred without incident, and States gradually shifted\nto pentobarbital as their supplies of sodium thiopental\nran out. It is reported that pentobarbital was used in all\nof the 43 executions carried out in 2012. The Death\nPenalty Institute, Execution List 2012, online at www.\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2012     (all   Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2015, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). Petitioners concede that pentobarbi-\ntal, like sodium thiopental, can “reliably induce and main-\ntain a comalike state that renders a person insensate to\npain” caused by administration of the second and third\ndrugs in the protocol. Brief for Petitioners 2. And courts\nacross the country have held that the use of pentobarbital\nin executions does not violate the Eighth Amendment.\nSee, e.g., Jackson v. Danberg, 656 F. 3d 157 (CA3 2011);\nBeaty v. Brewer, 649 F. 3d 1071 (CA9 2011); DeYoung v.\nOwens, 646 F. 3d 1319 (CA11 2011); Pavatt v. Jones, 627\nF. 3d 1336 (CA10 2010).\n   Before long, however, pentobarbital also became una-\nvailable. Anti-death-penalty advocates lobbied the Danish\nmanufacturer of the drug to stop selling it for use in exe-\n\f6                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncutions. See Bonner, supra. That manufacturer opposed\nthe death penalty and took steps to block the shipment of\npentobarbital for use in executions in the United States.\nStein, New Obstacle to Death Penalty in U. S., Washing-\nton Post, July 3, 2011, p. A4. Oklahoma eventually be-\ncame unable to acquire the drug through any means. The\nDistrict Court below found that both sodium thiopental\nand pentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma. App.\n67–68.\n                             C\n  Unable to acquire either sodium thiopental or pentobar-\nbital, some States have turned to midazolam, a sedative in\nthe benzodiazepine family of drugs. In October 2013,\nFlorida became the first State to substitute midazolam for\npentobarbital as part of a three-drug lethal injection pro-\ntocol. Fernandez, Executions Stall As States Seek Differ-\nent Drugs, N. Y. Times, Nov. 9, 2013, p. A1. To date,\nFlorida has conducted 11 executions using that protocol,\nwhich calls for midazolam followed by a paralytic agent\nand potassium chloride. See Brief for State of Florida as\nAmicus Curiae 2–3; Chavez v. Florida SP Warden, 742\nF. 3d 1267, 1269 (CA11 2014). In 2014, Oklahoma also\nsubstituted midazolam for pentobarbital as part of its\nthree-drug protocol. Oklahoma has already used this\nthree-drug protocol twice: to execute Clayton Lockett in\nApril 2014 and Charles Warner in January 2015. (Warner\nwas one of the four inmates who moved for a preliminary\ninjunction in this case.)\n  The Lockett execution caused Oklahoma to implement\nnew safety precautions as part of its lethal injection proto-\ncol. When Oklahoma executed Lockett, its protocol called\nfor the administration of 100 milligrams of midazolam, as\ncompared to the 500 milligrams that are currently re-\nquired. On the morning of his execution, Lockett cut\nhimself twice at “ ‘the bend of the elbow.’ ” App. 50. That\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevening, the execution team spent nearly an hour making\nat least one dozen attempts to establish intravenous (IV)\naccess to Lockett’s cardiovascular system, including at his\narms and elsewhere on his body. The team eventually\nbelieved that it had established intravenous access\nthrough Lockett’s right femoral vein, and it covered the\ninjection access point with a sheet, in part to preserve\nLockett’s dignity during the execution. After the team\nadministered the midazolam and a physician determined\nthat Lockett was unconscious, the team next administered\nthe paralytic agent (vecuronium bromide) and most of the\npotassium chloride. Lockett began to move and speak, at\nwhich point the physician lifted the sheet and determined\nthat the IV had “infiltrated,” which means that “the IV\nfluid, rather than entering Lockett’s blood stream, had\nleaked into the tissue surrounding the IV access point.”\nWarner v. Gross, 776 F. 3d 721, 725 (CA10 2015) (case\nbelow). The execution team stopped administering the\nremaining potassium chloride and terminated the execu-\ntion about 33 minutes after the midazolam was first in-\njected. About 10 minutes later, Lockett was pronounced\ndead.\n   An investigation into the Lockett execution concluded\nthat “the viability of the IV access point was the single\ngreatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in admin-\nistering the execution drugs.” App. 398. The investiga-\ntion, which took five months to complete, recommended\nseveral changes to Oklahoma’s execution protocol, and\nOklahoma adopted a new protocol with an effective date of\nSeptember 30, 2014. That protocol allows the Oklahoma\nDepartment of Corrections to choose among four different\ndrug combinations. The option that Oklahoma plans to\nuse to execute petitioners calls for the administration of\n500 milligrams of midazolam followed by a paralytic agent\n\f8                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nand potassium chloride.1 The paralytic agent may be\npancuronium bromide, vecuronium bromide, or rocuronium\nbromide, three drugs that, all agree, are functionally\nequivalent for purposes of this case. The protocol also\nincludes procedural safeguards to help ensure that an\ninmate remains insensate to any pain caused by the ad-\nministration of the paralytic agent and potassium chlo-\nride. Those safeguards include: (1) the insertion of both a\nprimary and backup IV catheter, (2) procedures to confirm\nthe viability of the IV site, (3) the option to postpone an\nexecution if viable IV sites cannot be established within an\nhour, (4) a mandatory pause between administration of\nthe first and second drugs, (5) numerous procedures for\nmonitoring the offender’s consciousness, including the use\nof an electrocardiograph and direct observation, and\n(6) detailed provisions with respect to the training and\npreparation of the execution team. In January of this\nyear, Oklahoma executed Warner using these revised\nprocedures and the combination of midazolam, a paralytic\nagent, and potassium chloride.\n                            II\n\n\n                            A\n\n  In June 2014, after Oklahoma switched from pentobar-\nbital to midazolam and executed Lockett, 21 Oklahoma\ndeath row inmates filed an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983\nchallenging the State’s new lethal injection protocol. The\ncomplaint alleged that Oklahoma’s use of midazolam\nviolates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and\nunusual punishment.\n  In November 2014, four of those plaintiffs—Richard\n\n——————\n    1 The\n        three other drug combinations that Oklahoma may admin-\nister are: (1) a single dose of pentobarbital, (2) a single dose of\nsodium thiopental, and (3) a dose of midazolam followed by a dose of\nhydromorphone.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGlossip, Benjamin Cole, John Grant, and Warner—filed a\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. All four men had\nbeen convicted of murder and sentenced to death by Okla-\nhoma juries. Glossip hired Justin Sneed to kill his em-\nployer, Barry Van Treese. Sneed entered a room where\nVan Treese was sleeping and beat him to death with a\nbaseball bat. See Glossip v. State, 2007 OK CR 12, 157\nP. 3d 143, 147–149. Cole murdered his 9-month-old\ndaughter after she would not stop crying. Cole bent her\nbody backwards until he snapped her spine in half. After\nthe child died, Cole played video games. See Cole v. State,\n2007 OK CR 27, 164 P. 3d 1089, 1092–1093. Grant, while\nserving terms of imprisonment totaling 130 years, killed\nGay Carter, a prison food service supervisor, by pulling\nher into a mop closet and stabbing her numerous times\nwith a shank. See Grant v. State, 2002 OK CR 36, 58\nP. 3d 783, 789. Warner anally raped and murdered an 11-\nmonth-old girl. The child’s injuries included two skull\nfractures, internal brain injuries, two fractures to her jaw,\na lacerated liver, and a bruised spleen and lungs. See\nWarner v. State, 2006 OK CR 40, 144 P. 3d 838, 856–857.\n  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the\nmurder conviction and death sentence of each offender.\nEach of the men then unsuccessfully sought both state\npostconviction and federal habeas corpus relief. Having\nexhausted the avenues for challenging their convictions\nand sentences, they moved for a preliminary injunction\nagainst Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol.\n                            B\n  In December 2014, after discovery, the District Court\nheld a 3-day evidentiary hearing on the preliminary in-\njunction motion. The District Court heard testimony from\n17 witnesses and reviewed numerous exhibits. Dr. David\nLubarsky, an anesthesiologist, and Dr. Larry Sasich, a\ndoctor of pharmacy, provided expert testimony about\n\f10                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmidazolam for petitioners, and Dr. Roswell Evans, a\ndoctor of pharmacy, provided expert testimony for\nrespondents.\n   After reviewing the evidence, the District Court issued\nan oral ruling denying the motion for a preliminary in-\njunction. The District Court first rejected petitioners’\nchallenge under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993), to the testimony of Dr. Evans.\nIt concluded that Dr. Evans, the Dean of Auburn Universi-\nty’s School of Pharmacy, was well qualified to testify about\nmidazolam’s properties and that he offered reliable testi-\nmony. The District Court then held that petitioners failed\nto establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth\nAmendment. The court provided two independent reasons\nfor this conclusion. First, the court held that petitioners\nfailed to identify a known and available method of execu-\ntion that presented a substantially less severe risk of pain\nthan the method that the State proposed to use. Second,\nthe court found that petitioners failed to prove that Okla-\nhoma’s protocol “presents a risk that is ‘sure or very likely\nto cause serious illness and needless suffering,’ amounting\nto ‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” App. 96 (quot-\ning Baze, 553 U. S., at 50). The court emphasized that the\nOklahoma protocol featured numerous safeguards, includ-\ning the establishment of two IV access sites, confirmation\nof the viability of those sites, and monitoring of the offend-\ner’s level of consciousness throughout the procedure.\n   The District Court supported its decision with findings\nof fact about midazolam. It found that a 500-milligram\ndose of midazolam “would make it a virtual certainty that\nany individual will be at a sufficient level of unconscious-\nness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from\nthe application of the second and third drugs.” App. 77.\nIndeed, it found that a 500-milligram dose alone would\nlikely cause death by respiratory arrest within 30 minutes\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor an hour.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\n776 F. 3d 721. The Court of Appeals explained that our\ndecision in Baze requires a plaintiff challenging a lethal\ninjection protocol to demonstrate that the risk of severe\npain presented by an execution protocol is substantial\n“ ‘when compared to the known and available alterna-\ntives.’ ” Id., at 732 (quoting Baze, supra, at 61). And it\nagreed with the District Court that petitioners had not\nidentified any such alternative. The Court of Appeals\nadded, however, that this holding was “not outcome-\ndeterminative in this case” because petitioners additionally\nfailed to establish that the use of midazolam creates a\ndemonstrated risk of severe pain. 776 F. 3d, at 732. The\nCourt of Appeals found that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion by relying on Dr. Evans’ testimony,\nand it concluded that the District Court’s factual findings\nabout midazolam were not clearly erroneous. It also held\nthat alleged errors in Dr. Evans’ testimony did not render\nhis testimony unreliable or the District Court’s findings\nclearly erroneous.\n   Oklahoma executed Warner on January 15, 2015, but\nwe subsequently voted to grant review and then stayed\nthe executions of Glossip, Cole, and Grant pending the\nresolution of this case. 574 U. S. ___ (2015).\n                              III\n   “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must estab-\nlish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of prelimi-\nnary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor,\nand that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20\n(2008). The parties agree that this case turns on whether\npetitioners are able to establish a likelihood of success on\nthe merits.\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the inflic-\ntion of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The controlling\nopinion in Baze outlined what a prisoner must establish to\nsucceed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution\nclaim. Baze involved a challenge by Kentucky death row\ninmates to that State’s three-drug lethal injection protocol\nof sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium\nchloride. The inmates conceded that the protocol, if\nproperly administered, would result in a humane and\nconstitutional execution because sodium thiopental would\nrender an inmate oblivious to any pain caused by the\nsecond and third drugs. 553 U. S., at 49. But they argued\nthat there was an unacceptable risk that sodium thiopen-\ntal would not be properly administered. Ibid. The in-\nmates also maintained that a significant risk of harm\ncould be eliminated if Kentucky adopted a one-drug proto-\ncol and additional monitoring by trained personnel. Id., at\n51.\n   The controlling opinion in Baze first concluded that\nprisoners cannot successfully challenge a method of execu-\ntion unless they establish that the method presents a risk\nthat is “ ‘sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering,’ and give rise to ‘sufficiently imminent\ndangers.’ ” Id., at 50 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU. S. 25, 33, 34–35 (1993)). To prevail on such a claim,\n“there must be a ‘substantial risk of serious harm,’ an\n‘objectively intolerable risk of harm’ that prevents prison\nofficials from pleading that they were ‘subjectively blame-\nless for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.’ ” 553 U. S.,\nat 50 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 846, and\nn. 9 (1994)). The controlling opinion also stated that\nprisoners “cannot successfully challenge a State’s method\nof execution merely by showing a slightly or marginally\nsafer alternative.” 553 U. S., at 51. Instead, prisoners\nmust identify an alternative that is “feasible, readily\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimplemented, and in fact significantly reduce[s] a substan-\ntial risk of severe pain.” Id., at 52.\n   The controlling opinion summarized the requirements of\nan Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim as\nfollows: “A stay of execution may not be granted on\ngrounds such as those asserted here unless the condemned\nprisoner establishes that the State’s lethal injection proto-\ncol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. [And] [h]e\nmust show that the risk is substantial when compared to\nthe known and available alternatives.” Id., at 61. The\npreliminary injunction posture of the present case thus\nrequires petitioners to establish a likelihood that they can\nestablish both that Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol\ncreates a demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the\nrisk is substantial when compared to the known and\navailable alternatives.\n   The challenge in Baze failed both because the Kentucky\ninmates did not show that the risks they identified were\nsubstantial and imminent, id., at 56, and because they did\nnot establish the existence of a known and available alter-\nnative method of execution that would entail a significantly\nless severe risk, id., at 57–60. Petitioners’ arguments\nhere fail for similar reasons. First, petitioners have not\nproved that any risk posed by midazolam is substantial\nwhen compared to known and available alternative meth-\nods of execution. Second, they have failed to establish that\nthe District Court committed clear error when it found\nthat the use of midazolam will not result in severe pain\nand suffering. We address each reason in turn.\n                              IV\n  Our first ground for affirmance is based on petitioners’\nfailure to satisfy their burden of establishing that any risk\nof harm was substantial when compared to a known and\navailable alternative method of execution.          In their\namended complaint, petitioners proffered that the State\n\f14                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncould use sodium thiopental as part of a single-drug proto-\ncol. They have since suggested that it might also be con-\nstitutional for Oklahoma to use pentobarbital. But the\nDistrict Court found that both sodium thiopental and\npentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma’s De-\npartment of Corrections. The Court of Appeals affirmed\nthat finding, and it is not clearly erroneous. On the con-\ntrary, the record shows that Oklahoma has been unable to\nprocure those drugs despite a good-faith effort to do so.\n  Petitioners do not seriously contest this factual finding,\nand they have not identified any available drug or drugs\nthat could be used in place of those that Oklahoma is now\nunable to obtain. Nor have they shown a risk of pain so\ngreat that other acceptable, available methods must be\nused. Instead, they argue that they need not identify a\nknown and available method of execution that presents\nless risk. But this argument is inconsistent with the\ncontrolling opinion in Baze, 553 U. S., at 61, which im-\nposed a requirement that the Court now follows.2\n  Petitioners contend that the requirement to identify an\nalternative method of execution contravenes our pre-Baze\ndecision in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 573 (2006), but\nthey misread that decision. The portion of the opinion in\nHill on which they rely concerned a question of civil pro-\ncedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment question. In\n\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent (hereinafter principal dissent), post, at\n24–25, inexplicably refuses to recognize that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s\nopinion in Baze sets out the holding of the case. In Baze, the opinion of\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was joined by two other JUSTICES. JUSTICES SCALIA\nand THOMAS took the broader position that a method of execution is\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment unless it is deliberately de-\nsigned to inflict pain. 553 U. S., at 94 (THOMAS, J. concurring in judg-\nment). Thus, as explained in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188,\n193 (1977), THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion sets out the holding of the\ncase. It is for this reason that petitioners base their argument on the\nrule set out in that opinion. See Brief for Petitioners 25, 28.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHill, the issue was whether a challenge to a method of\nexecution must be brought by means of an application for\na writ of habeas corpus or a civil action under §1983. Id.,\nat 576. We held that a method-of-execution claim must be\nbrought under §1983 because such a claim does not attack\nthe validity of the prisoner’s conviction or death sentence.\nId., at 579–580. The United States as amicus curiae\nargued that we should adopt a special pleading require-\nment to stop inmates from using §1983 actions to attack,\nnot just a particular means of execution, but the death\npenalty itself. To achieve this end, the United States\nproposed that an inmate asserting a method-of-execution\nclaim should be required to plead an acceptable alterna-\ntive method of execution. Id., at 582. We rejected that\nargument because “[s]pecific pleading requirements are\nmandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and\nnot, as a general rule, through case-by-case determina-\ntions of the federal courts.” Ibid. Hill thus held that\n§1983 alone does not impose a heightened pleading re-\nquirement. Baze, on the other hand, addressed the sub-\nstantive elements of an Eighth Amendment method-of-\nexecution claim, and it made clear that the Eighth\nAmendment requires a prisoner to plead and prove a\nknown and available alternative. Because petitioners\nfailed to do this, the District Court properly held that they\ndid not establish a likelihood of success on their Eighth\nAmendment claim.\n   Readers can judge for themselves how much distance\nthere is between the principal dissent’s argument against\nrequiring prisoners to identify an alternative and the\nview, now announced by JUSTICES BREYER and GINSBURG,\nthat the death penalty is categorically unconstitutional.\nPost, p. ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting). The principal dissent\ngoes out of its way to suggest that a State would violate\nthe Eighth Amendment if it used one of the methods of\nexecution employed before the advent of lethal injection.\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPost, at 30–31. And the principal dissent makes this\nsuggestion even though the Court held in Wilkerson that\nthis method (the firing squad) is constitutional and even\nthough, in the words of the principal dissent, “there is\nsome reason to think that it is relatively quick and pain-\nless.” Post, at 30. Tellingly silent about the methods of\nexecution most commonly used before States switched to\nlethal injection (the electric chair and gas chamber), the\nprincipal dissent implies that it would be unconstitutional\nto use a method that “could be seen as a devolution to a\nmore primitive era.” Ibid. If States cannot return to any\nof the “more primitive” methods used in the past and if no\ndrug that meets with the principal dissent’s approval is\navailable for use in carrying out a death sentence, the\nlogical conclusion is clear. But we have time and again\nreaffirmed that capital punishment is not per se unconsti-\ntutional. See, e.g., Baze, 553 U. S., at 47; id., at 87–88\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Gregg, 428 U. S., at\n187 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.);\nid., at 226 (White, J., concurring in judgment); Resweber,\n329 U. S., at 464; In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447; Wilker-\nson, 99 U. S., at 134–135. We decline to effectively over-\nrule these decisions.\n                            V\n  We also affirm for a second reason: The District Court\ndid not commit clear error when it found that midazolam\nis highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain\nduring an execution. We emphasize four points at the\noutset of our analysis.\n  First, we review the District Court’s factual findings\nunder the deferential “clear error” standard. This stand-\nard does not entitle us to overturn a finding “simply be-\ncause [we are] convinced that [we] would have decided the\ncase differently.” Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S.\n564, 573 (1985).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, petitioners bear the burden of persuasion on\nthis issue. Baze, supra, at 41. Although petitioners\nexpend great effort attacking peripheral aspects of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony, they make little attempt to prove what\nis critical, i.e., that the evidence they presented to the\nDistrict Court establishes that the use of midazolam is\nsure or very likely to result in needless suffering.\n   Third, numerous courts have concluded that the use of\nmidazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is\nlikely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might\nresult from administration of the paralytic agent and\npotassium chloride. See, e.g., 776 F. 3d 721 (case below\naffirming the District Court); Chavez v. Florida SP War-\nden, 742 F. 3d 1267 (affirming the District Court); Banks\nv. State, 150 So. 3d 797 (Fla. 2014) (affirming the lower\ncourt); Howell v. State, 133 So. 3d 511 (Fla. 2014) (same);\nMuhammad v. State, 132 So. 3d 176 (Fla. 2013) (same).\n(It is noteworthy that one or both of the two key witnesses\nin this case—Dr. Lubarsky for petitioners and Dr. Evans\nfor respondents—were witnesses in the Chavez, Howell,\nand Muhammad cases.) “Where an intermediate court\nreviews, and affirms, a trial court’s factual findings, this\nCourt will not ‘lightly overturn’ the concurrent findings of\nthe two lower courts.” Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234,\n242 (2001). Our review is even more deferential where, as\nhere, multiple trial courts have reached the same finding,\nand multiple appellate courts have affirmed those find-\nings. Cf. Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830,\n841 (1996) (explaining that this Court “ ‘cannot undertake\nto review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below\nin the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing\nof error’ ” (quoting Graver Tank & Mfg.

Neither argument\nsucceeds.\n  The District Court found that midazolam is capable of\nplacing a person “at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to\nresist the noxious stimuli which could occur from the\n\n——————\n   3 Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich, petitioners’ key witnesses, both testified\n\nthat midazolam is inappropriate for a third reason, namely, that it\ncreates a risk of “paradoxical reactions” such as agitation, hyperactiv-\nity, and combativeness. App. 175 (expert report of Dr. Lubarsky); id., at\n242, 244 (expert report of Dr. Sasich). The District Court found, how-\never, that the frequency with which a paradoxical reaction occurs “is\nspeculative” and that the risk “occurs with the highest frequency in low\ntherapeutic doses.” Id., at 78. Indeed, Dr. Sasich conceded that the\nincidence or risk of paradoxical reactions with midazolam “is unknown”\nand that reports estimate the risk to vary only “from 1% to above 10%.”\nId., at 244. Moreover, the mere fact that a method of execution might\nresult in some unintended side effects does not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation. “[T]he Constitution does not demand the avoid-\nance of all risk of pain.” Baze, 553 U. S., at 47 (plurality opinion).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of the second and third drugs.” App. 77. This\nconclusion was not clearly erroneous. Respondents’ ex-\npert, Dr. Evans, testified that the proper administration of\na 500-milligram dose of midazolam would make it “a\nvirtual certainty” that any individual would be “at a suffi-\ncient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli\nwhich could occur from application of the 2nd and 3rd\ndrugs” used in the Oklahoma protocol. Id., at 302; see also\nid., at 322. And petitioners’ experts acknowledged that\nthey had no contrary scientific proof. See id., at 243–244\n(Dr. Sasich stating that the ability of midazolam to render\na person insensate to the second and third drugs “has not\nbeen subjected to scientific testing”); id., at 176 (Dr.\nLubarksy stating that “there is no scientific literature\naddressing the use of midazolam as a manner to adminis-\nter lethal injections in humans”).\n  In an effort to explain this dearth of evidence, Dr. Sasich\ntestified that “[i]t’s not my responsibility or the [Food and\nDrug Administration’s] responsibility to prove that the\ndrug doesn’t work or is not safe.” Tr. of Preliminary In-\njunction Hearing 357 (Tr.). Instead, he stated, “it’s the\nresponsibility of the proponent to show that the drug is\nsafe and effective.” Ibid. Dr. Sasich confused the stand-\nard imposed on a drug manufacturer seeking approval of a\ntherapeutic drug with the standard that must be borne by\na party challenging a State’s lethal injection protocol.\nWhen a method of execution is authorized under state law,\na party contending that this method violates the Eighth\nAmendment bears the burden of showing that the method\ncreates an unacceptable risk of pain. Here, petitioners’\nown experts effectively conceded that they lacked evidence\nto prove their case beyond dispute.\n  Petitioners attempt to avoid this deficiency by criticizing\nrespondents’ expert. They argue that the District Court\nshould not have credited Dr. Evans’ testimony because he\nadmitted that his findings were based on “ ‘extrapo-\n\f20                       GLOSSIP v.

See Brief for Petitioners 34 (citing Tr.\n667–668; emphasis deleted). But because a 500-milligram\ndose is never administered for a therapeutic purpose,\nextrapolation was reasonable. And the conclusions of\npetitioners’ experts were also based on extrapolations and\nassumptions. For example, Dr. Lubarsky relied on “ex-\ntrapolation of the ceiling effect data.” App. 177.\n   Based on the evidence that the parties presented to the\nDistrict Court, we must affirm. Testimony from both sides\nsupports the District Court’s conclusion that midazolam\ncan render a person insensate to pain. Dr. Evans testified\nthat although midazolam is not an analgesic, it can none-\ntheless “render the person unconscious and ‘insen-\nsate’ during the remainder of the procedure.” Id., at 294.\nIn his discussion about the ceiling effect, Dr. Sasich agreed\nthat as the dose of midazolam increases, it is “expected to\nproduce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to\nstimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).” Id., at 243.\nPetitioners argue that midazolam is not powerful enough\nto keep a person insensate to pain after the administration\nof the second and third drugs, but Dr. Evans presented\ncreditable testimony to the contrary. See, e.g., Tr. 661\n(testifying that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will\ninduce a coma).4 Indeed, low doses of midazolam are\nsufficient to induce unconsciousness and are even some-\n\n\n——————\n   4 The principal dissent misunderstands the record when it bizarrely\n\nsuggests that midazolam is about as dangerous as a peanut. Post, at\n15. Dr. Evans and Dr. Lubarsky agreed that midazolam has caused\nfatalities in doses as low as 0.04 to 0.07 milligrams per kilogram. App.\n217, 294. Even if death from such low doses is a “rare, unfortunate side\neffec[t],” post, at 15, the District Court found that a massive 500-\nmilligram dose—many times higher than the lowest dose reported to\nhave produced death—will likely cause death in under an hour.

Dr. Sasich conceded, for example, that mid-\nazolam might be used for medical procedures like colonos-\ncopies and gastroscopies. App. 267–268; see also Brief for\nRespondents 6–8.5\n  Petitioners emphasize that midazolam is not recom-\nmended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during\npainful surgery, but there are two reasons why this is not\ndispositive. First, as the District Court found, the 500-\nmilligram dose at issue here “is many times higher than a\nnormal therapeutic dose of midazolam.” App. 76. The\neffect of a small dose of midazolam has minimal probative\nvalue about the effect of a 500-milligram dose. Second, the\nfact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for\nmaintaining unconsciousness during surgery says little\nabout whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is\nconstitutionally adequate for purposes of conducting an\nexecution. We recognized this point in Baze, where we\nconcluded that although the medical standard of care\nmight require the use of a blood pressure cuff and an\nelectrocardiogram during surgeries, this does not mean\nthose procedures are required for an execution to pass\nEighth Amendment scrutiny. 553 U. S., at 60.\n  Oklahoma has also adopted important safeguards to\nensure that midazolam is properly administered. The\n\n——————\n  5 Petitioners’experts also declined to testify that a 500-milligram\ndose of midazolam is always insufficient to place a person in a coma\nand render him insensate to pain. Dr. Lubarsky argued only that the\n500-milligram dose cannot “reliably” produce a coma. Id., 228. And\nwhen Dr. Sasich was asked whether he could say to a reasonable\ndegree of certainty that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would not\nrender someone unconscious, he replied that he could not. Id., at 271–\n272. A product label for midazolam that Dr. Sasich attached to his\nexpert report also acknowledged that an overdose of midazolam can\ncause a coma. See Expert Report of Larry D. Sasich, in No. 14–6244\n(CA10), p. 34.\n\f22                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court emphasized three requirements in particu-\nlar: The execution team must secure both a primary and\nbackup IV access site, it must confirm the viability of the\nIV sites, and it must continuously monitor the offender’s\nlevel of consciousness. The District Court did not commit\nclear error in concluding that these safeguards help to\nminimize any risk that might occur in the event that\nmidazolam does not operate as intended. Indeed, we\nconcluded in Baze that many of the safeguards that Okla-\nhoma employs—including the establishment of a primary\nand backup IV and the presence of personnel to monitor\nan inmate—help in significantly reducing the risk that an\nexecution protocol will violate the Eighth Amendment.\nId., at 55–56. And many other safeguards that Oklahoma\nhas adopted mirror those that the dissent in Baze com-\nplained were absent from Kentucky’s protocol in that case.\nFor example, the dissent argued that because a conscious-\nness check before injection of the second drug “can reduce\na risk of dreadful pain,” Kentucky’s failure to include that\nstep in its procedure was unconstitutional. Id., at 119\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The dissent also complained\nthat Kentucky did not monitor the effectiveness of the first\ndrug or pause between injection of the first and second\ndrugs. Id., at 120–121. Oklahoma has accommodated\neach of those concerns.\n                              B\n   Petitioners assert that midazolam’s “ceiling effect”\nundermines the District Court’s finding about the effec-\ntiveness of the huge dose administered in the Oklahoma\nprotocol. Petitioners argue that midazolam has a “ceiling”\nabove which any increase in dosage produces no effect. As\na result, they maintain, it is wrong to assume that a 500-\nmilligram dose has a much greater effect than a therapeu-\ntic dose of about 5 milligrams. But the mere fact that\nmidazolam has such a ceiling cannot be dispositive. Dr.\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSasich testified that “all drugs essentially have a ceiling\neffect.” Tr. 343. The relevant question here is whether\nmidazolam’s ceiling effect occurs below the level of a 500-\nmilligram dose and at a point at which the drug does not\nhave the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain\ncaused by the second and third drugs.\n   Petitioners provided little probative evidence on this\npoint, and the speculative evidence that they did present\nto the District Court does not come close to establishing\nthat its factual findings were clearly erroneous.\nDr. Sasich stated in his expert report that the literature\n“indicates” that midazolam has a ceiling effect, but he\nconceded that he “was unable to determine the midazolam\ndose for a ceiling effect on unconsciousness because there\nis no literature in which such testing has been done.” App.\n243–244. Dr. Lubarsky’s report was similar, id., at 171–\n172, and the testimony of petitioners’ experts at the hear-\ning was no more compelling. Dr. Sasich frankly admitted\nthat he did a “search to try and determine at what dose of\nmidazolam you would get a ceiling effect,” but concluded:\n“I could not find one.” Tr. 344. The closest petitioners\ncame was Dr. Lubarsky’s suggestion that the ceiling effect\noccurs “[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams,” but\nhe added that he had not actually done the relevant calcu-\nlations, and he admitted: “I can’t tell you right now” at\nwhat dose the ceiling effect occurs. App. 225. We cannot\nconclude that the District Court committed clear error in\ndeclining to find, based on such speculative evidence, that\nthe ceiling effect negates midazolam’s ability to render an\ninmate insensate to pain caused by the second and third\ndrugs in the protocol.\n   The principal dissent discusses the ceiling effect at\nlength, but it studiously avoids suggesting that petitioners\npresented probative evidence about the dose at which the\nceiling effect occurs or about whether the effect occurs\nbefore a person becomes insensate to pain. The principal\n\f24                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent avoids these critical issues by suggesting that such\nevidence is “irrelevant if there is no dose at which the drug\ncan . . . render a person ‘insensate to pain.’ ” Post, at 17.\nBut the District Court heard evidence that the drug can\nrender a person insensate to pain, and not just from Dr.\nEvans: Dr. Sasich (one of petitioners’ own experts) testi-\nfied that higher doses of midazolam are “expected to pro-\nduce . . . lack of response to stimuli such as pain.” App.\n243.6\n   In their brief, petitioners attempt to deflect attention\nfrom their failure of proof regarding midazolam’s ceiling\neffect by criticizing Dr. Evans’ testimony. But it was\npetitioners’ burden to establish that midazolam’s ceiling\noccurred at a dosage below the massive 500-milligram\ndose employed in the Oklahoma protocol and at a point at\nwhich the drug failed to render the recipient insensate to\npain. They did not meet that burden, and their criticisms\ndo not undermine Dr. Evans’ central point, which the\nDistrict Court credited, that a properly administered 500-\nmilligram dose of midazolam will render the recipient\nunable to feel pain.\n   One of petitioners’ criticisms of Dr. Evans’ testimony is\nlittle more than a quibble about the wording chosen by Dr.\nEvans at one point in his oral testimony. Petitioners’\nexpert, Dr. Lubarsky, stated in his report that midazolam\n“increases effective binding of [gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(GABA)] to its receptor to induce unconsciousness.”7 App.\n——————\n  6 The principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s supposedly contra-\n\nry testimony, but the District Court was entitled to credit Dr. Evans\n(and Dr. Sasich) instead of Dr. Lubarsky on this point. And the District\nCourt had strong reasons not to credit Dr. Lubarsky, who even argued\nthat a protocol that includes sodium thiopental is “constructed to\nproduce egregious harm and suffering.” App. 227.\n  7 GABA is “an amino acid that functions as an inhibitory neuro-\n\ntransmitter in the brain and spinal cord.” Mosby’s Medical Dictionary\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)      25\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n172. Dr. Evans’ report provided a similar explanation of\nthe way in which midazolam works, see id., at 293–294,\nand Dr. Lubarsky did not dispute the accuracy of that\nexplanation when he testified at the hearing. Petitioners\ncontend, however, that Dr. Evans erred when he said at\nthe hearing that “[m]idazolam attaches to GABA recep-\ntors, inhibiting GABA.” Id., at 312 (emphasis added).\nPetitioners contend that this statement was incorrect\nbecause “far from inhibiting GABA, midazolam facilitates\nits binding to GABA receptors.” Brief for Petitioners 38.\n   In making this argument, petitioners are simply quar-\nrelling with the words that Dr. Evans used during oral\ntestimony in an effort to explain how midazolam works in\nterms understandable to a layman. Petitioners do not\nsuggest that the discussion of midazolam in Dr. Evans’\nexpert report was inaccurate, and as for Dr. Evans’ pass-\ning use of the term “inhibiting,” Dr. Lubarksy’s own expert\nreport states that GABA’s “inhibition of brain activity is\naccentuated by midazolam.” App. 232 (emphasis added).\nDr. Evans’ oral use of the word “inhibiting”—particularly\nin light of his written testimony—does not invalidate the\nDistrict Court’s decision to rely on his testimony.\n   Petitioners also point to an apparent conflict between\nDr. Evans’ testimony and a declaration by Dr. Lubarsky\n(submitted after the District Court ruled) regarding the\nbiological process that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nBut even if Dr. Lubarsky’s declaration is correct, it is\nlargely beside the point. What matters for present pur-\nposes is the dosage at which the ceiling effect kicks in, not\nthe biological process that produces the effect. And Dr.\nLubarsky’s declaration does not render the District Court’s\nfindings clearly erroneous with respect to that critical\nissue.\n\n——————\n782 (7th ed. 2006).\n\f26                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ remaining arguments about midazolam all\nlack merit. First, we are not persuaded by petitioners’\nargument that Dr. Evans’ testimony should have been\nrejected because of some of the sources listed in his report.\nPetitioners criticize two of the “selected references” that\nDr. Evans cited in his expert report: the Web site\ndrugs.com and a material safety data sheet (MSDS) about\nmidazolam. Petitioners’ argument is more of a Daubert\nchallenge to Dr. Evans’ testimony than an argument that\nthe District Court’s findings were clearly erroneous. The\nDistrict Court concluded that Dr. Evans was “well-\nqualified to give the expert testimony that he gave” and\nthat “his testimony was the product of reliable principles\nand methods reliably applied to the facts of this case.”\nApp. 75–76. To the extent that the reliability of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony is even before us, the District Court’s con-\nclusion that his testimony was based on reliable sources is\nreviewed under the deferential “abuse-of-discretion”\nstandard. General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 142–\n143 (1997). Dr. Evans relied on multiple sources and his\nown expertise, and his testimony may not be disqualified\nsimply because one source (drugs.com) warns that it “ ‘is\nnot intended for medical advice’ ” and another (the MSDS)\nstates that its information is provided “ ‘without any war-\nranty, express or implied, regarding its correctness.’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners 36. Medical journals that both par-\nties rely upon typically contain similar disclaimers. See,\ne.g., Anesthesiology, Terms and Conditions of Use, online\nat       http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/ss/terms.aspx\n(“None of the information on this Site shall be used to\ndiagnose or treat any health problem or disease”). Dr.\nLubarsky—petitioners’ own expert—relied on an MSDS to\nargue that midazolam has a ceiling effect. And petitioners\ndo not identify any incorrect statements from drugs.com\non which Dr. Evans relied. In fact, although Dr. Sasich\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubmitted a declaration to the Court of Appeals criticizing\nDr. Evans’ reference to drugs.com, that declaration does\nnot identify a single fact from that site’s discussion of\nmidazolam that was materially inaccurate.\n   Second, petitioners argue that Dr. Evans’ expert report\ncontained a mathematical error, but we find this argu-\nment insignificant. Dr. Evans stated in his expert report\nthat the lowest dose of midazolam resulting in human\ndeaths, according to an MSDS, is 0.071 mg/kg delivered\nintravenously. App. 294. Dr. Lubarsky agreed with this\nstatement. Specifically, he testified that fatalities have\noccurred in doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg, and he\nstated that Dr. Evans’ testimony to that effect was “a true\nstatement” (though he added those fatalities occurred\namong the elderly). Id., at 217. We do not understand\npetitioners to dispute the testimony of Dr. Evans and their\nown expert that 0.071 mg/kg is a potentially fatal dose of\nmidazolam. Instead, they make much of the fact that the\nMSDS attached to Dr. Evans’ report apparently contained\na typographical error and reported the lowest toxic dose as\n71 mg/kg. That Dr. Evans did not repeat that incorrect\nfigure but instead reported the correct dose supports\nrather than undermines his testimony. In any event, the\nalleged error in the MSDS is irrelevant because the Dis-\ntrict Court expressly stated that it did not rely on the\nfigure in the MSDS. See id., at 75.\n   Third, petitioners argue that there is no consensus\namong the States regarding midazolam’s efficacy because\nonly four States (Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio)\nhave used midazolam as part of an execution. Petitioners\nrely on the plurality’s statement in Baze that “it is difficult\nto regard a practice as ‘objectively intolerable’ when it is in\nfact widely tolerated,” and the plurality’s emphasis on the\nfact that 36 States had adopted lethal injection and 30\nStates used the particular three-drug protocol at issue in\nthat case. 553 U. S., at 53. But while the near-universal\n\f28                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of the particular protocol at issue in Baze supported\nour conclusion that this protocol did not violate the Eighth\nAmendment, we did not say that the converse was true,\ni.e., that other protocols or methods of execution are of\ndoubtful constitutionality. That argument, if accepted,\nwould hamper the adoption of new and potentially more\nhumane methods of execution and would prevent States\nfrom adapting to changes in the availability of suitable\ndrugs.\n   Fourth, petitioners argue that difficulties with Oklaho-\nma’s execution of Lockett and Arizona’s July 2014 execu-\ntion of Joseph Wood establish that midazolam is sure or\nvery likely to cause serious pain. We are not persuaded.\nAside from the Lockett execution, 12 other executions\nhave been conducted using the three-drug protocol at issue\nhere, and those appear to have been conducted without\nany significant problems. See Brief for Respondents 32;\nBrief for State of Florida as Amicus Curiae 1. Moreover,\nLockett was administered only 100 milligrams of midazo-\nlam, and Oklahoma’s investigation into that execution\nconcluded that the difficulties were due primarily to the\nexecution team’s inability to obtain an IV access site. And\nthe Wood execution did not involve the protocol at issue\nhere. Wood did not receive a single dose of 500 milligrams\nof midazolam; instead, he received fifteen 50-milligram\ndoses over the span of two hours.8 Brief for Respondents\n——————\n  8 The  principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s testimony that it is\nirrelevant that Wood was administered the drug over a 2-hour period.\nPost, at 20. But Dr. Evans disagreed and testified that if a 750-\nmilligram dose “was spread out over a long period of time,” such as one\nhour (i.e., half the time at issue in the Wood execution), the drug might\nnot be as effective as if it were administered all at once. Tr. 667. The\nprincipal dissent states that this “pronouncement was entirely unsup-\nported,” post, at 20, n. 6, but it was supported by Dr. Evans’ expertise\nand decades of experience.

And Arizona used a different two-drug protocol\nthat paired midazolam with hydromorphone, a drug that\nis not at issue in this case. Ibid. When all of the circum-\nstances are considered, the Lockett and Wood executions\nhave little probative value for present purposes.\n   Finally, we find it appropriate to respond to the princi-\npal dissent’s groundless suggestion that our decision is\ntantamount to allowing prisoners to be “drawn and quar-\ntered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the\nstake.” Post, at 28. That is simply not true, and the prin-\ncipal dissent’s resort to this outlandish rhetoric reveals the\nweakness of its legal arguments.\n                              VI\n  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nmedical journal.\n  After the Wood execution, Arizona commissioned an independent\nassessment of its execution protocol and the Wood execution.

And now, acknowledging that their convictions are\nunassailable, they ask us for clemency, as though clemency\nwere ours to give.\n   The response is also familiar: A vocal minority of the\nCourt, waving over their heads a ream of the most recent\nabolitionist studies (a superabundant genre) as though\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthey have discovered the lost folios of Shakespeare, insist\nthat now, at long last, the death penalty must be abolished\nfor good. Mind you, not once in the history of the Ameri-\ncan Republic has this Court ever suggested the death\npenalty is categorically impermissible. The reason is\nobvious: It is impossible to hold unconstitutional that\nwhich the Constitution explicitly contemplates. The Fifth\nAmendment provides that “[n]o person shall be held to\nanswer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or\nindictment of a Grand Jury,” and that no person shall be\n“deprived of life . . . without due process of law.” Never-\ntheless, today JUSTICE BREYER takes on the role of the\nabolitionists in this long-running drama, arguing that the\ntext of the Constitution and two centuries of history must\nyield to his “20 years of experience on this Court,” and\ninviting full briefing on the continued permissibility of\ncapital punishment, post, at 2 (dissenting opinion).\n  Historically, the Eighth Amendment was understood to\nbar only those punishments that added “ ‘terror, pain, or\ndisgrace’ ” to an otherwise permissible capital sentence.\nBaze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 96 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Rather than bother with this troubling\ndetail, JUSTICE BREYER elects to contort the constitutional\ntext. Redefining “cruel” to mean “unreliable,” “arbitrary,”\nor causing “excessive delays,” and “unusual” to include a\n“decline in use,” he proceeds to offer up a white paper\ndevoid of any meaningful legal argument.\n  Even accepting JUSTICE BREYER’s rewriting of the\nEighth Amendment, his argument is full of internal con-\ntradictions and (it must be said) gobbledy-gook. He says\nthat the death penalty is cruel because it is unreliable; but\nit is convictions, not punishments, that are unreliable.\nMoreover, the “pressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors\nto secure a conviction,” which he claims increases the risk\nof wrongful convictions in capital cases, flows from the\nnature of the crime, not the punishment that follows its\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges as\nmuch: “[T]he crimes at issue in capital cases are typically\nhorrendous murders, and thus accompanied by intense\ncommunity pressure.” Ibid. That same pressure would\nexist, and the same risk of wrongful convictions, if horren-\ndous death-penalty cases were converted into equally\nhorrendous life-without-parole cases. The reality is that\nany innocent defendant is infinitely better off appealing a\ndeath sentence than a sentence of life imprisonment.\n(Which, again, JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges: “[C]ourts\n(or State Governors) are 130 times more likely to exoner-\nate a defendant where a death sentence is at issue,” post,\nat 5.) The capital convict will obtain endless legal assis-\ntance from the abolition lobby (and legal favoritism from\nabolitionist judges), while the lifer languishes unnoticed\nbehind bars.\n   JUSTICE BREYER next says that the death penalty is\ncruel because it is arbitrary. To prove this point, he points\nto a study of 205 cases that “measured the ‘egregiousness’\nof the murderer’s conduct” with “a system of metrics,” and\nthen “compared the egregiousness of the conduct of the 9\ndefendants sentenced to death with the egregiousness of\nthe conduct of defendants in the remaining 196 cases [who\nwere not sentenced to death],” post, at 10–11. If only\nAristotle, Aquinas, and Hume knew that moral philosophy\ncould be so neatly distilled into a pocket-sized, vade me-\ncum “system of metrics.” Of course it cannot: Egregious-\nness is a moral judgment susceptible of few hard-and-fast\nrules. More importantly, egregiousness of the crime is\nonly one of several factors that render a punishment con-\ndign—culpability, rehabilitative potential, and the need\nfor deterrence also are relevant. That is why this Court\nhas required an individualized consideration of all miti-\ngating circumstances, rather than formulaic application of\nsome egregiousness test.\n   It is because these questions are contextual and admit of\n\f4                     GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nno easy answers that we rely on juries to make judgments\nabout the people and crimes before them. The fact that\nthese judgments may vary across cases is an inevitable\nconsequence of the jury trial, that cornerstone of Anglo-\nAmerican judicial procedure. But when a punishment is\nauthorized by law—if you kill you are subject to death—\nthe fact that some defendants receive mercy from their\njury no more renders the underlying punishment “cruel”\nthan does the fact that some guilty individuals are never\napprehended, are never tried, are acquitted, or are\npardoned.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s third reason that the death penalty is\ncruel is that it entails delay, thereby (1) subjecting in-\nmates to long periods on death row and (2) undermining\nthe penological justifications of the death penalty. The\nfirst point is nonsense. Life without parole is an even\nlengthier period than the wait on death row; and if the\nobjection is that death row is a more confining environ-\nment, the solution should be modifying the environment\nrather than abolishing the death penalty. As for the\nargument that delay undermines the penological ration-\nales for the death penalty: In insisting that “the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates,” post, at\n24, JUSTICE BREYER apparently forgets that one of the\nplaintiffs in this very case was already in prison when he\ncommitted the murder that landed him on death row.\nJUSTICE BREYER further asserts that “whatever interest in\nretribution might be served by the death penalty as cur-\nrently administered, that interest can be served almost as\nwell by a sentence of life in prison without parole,” post, at\n27. My goodness. If he thinks the death penalty not much\nmore harsh (and hence not much more retributive), why is\nhe so keen to get rid of it? With all due respect, whether\nthe death penalty and life imprisonment constitute more-\nor-less equivalent retribution is a question far above the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\njudiciary’s pay grade. Perhaps JUSTICE BREYER is more\nforgiving—or more enlightened—than those who, like\nKant, believe that death is the only just punishment for\ntaking a life. I would not presume to tell parents whose\nlife has been forever altered by the brutal murder of a\nchild that life imprisonment is punishment enough.\n   And finally, JUSTICE BREYER speculates that it does not\n“seem likely” that the death penalty has a “significant”\ndeterrent effect. Post, at 25. It seems very likely to me,\nand there are statistical studies that say so. See, e.g.,\nZimmerman, State Executions, Deterrence, and the Inci-\ndence of Murder, 7 J. Applied Econ. 163, 166 (2004) (“[I]t\nis estimated that each state execution deters approximately\nfourteen murders per year on average”); Dezhbakhsh,\nRubin, & Shepherd, Does Capital Punishment Have a\nDeterrent Effect? New Evidence from Postmoratorium\nPanel Data, 5 Am. L. & Econ. Rev. 344 (2003) (“[E]ach\nexecution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders”\nper year); Sunstein & Vermeule, Is Capital Punishment\nMorally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life\nTradeoffs, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2005) (“All in all, the\nrecent evidence of a deterrent effect from capital punish-\nment seems impressive, especially in light of its ‘apparent\npower and unanimity’ ”). But we federal judges live in a\nworld apart from the vast majority of Americans. After\nwork, we retire to homes in placid suburbia or to high-rise\nco-ops with guards at the door. We are not confronted\nwith the threat of violence that is ever present in many\nAmericans’ everyday lives. The suggestion that the in-\ncremental deterrent effect of capital punishment does not\nseem “significant” reflects, it seems to me, a let-them-eat-\ncake obliviousness to the needs of others. Let the People\ndecide how much incremental deterrence is appropriate.\n   Of course, this delay is a problem of the Court’s own\nmaking. As JUSTICE BREYER concedes, for more than 160\nyears, capital sentences were carried out in an average of\n\f6                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ntwo years or less. Post, at 18. But by 2014, he tells us, it\ntook an average of 18 years to carry out a death sentence.\nId., at 19. What happened in the intervening years?\nNothing other than the proliferation of labyrinthine re-\nstrictions on capital punishment, promulgated by this\nCourt under an interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\nthat empowered it to divine “the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society,”\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opin-\nion)—a task for which we are eminently ill suited. Indeed,\nfor the past two decades, JUSTICE BREYER has been the\nDrum Major in this parade. His invocation of the result-\nant delay as grounds for abolishing the death penalty calls\nto mind the man sentenced to death for killing his parents,\nwho pleads for mercy on the ground that he is an orphan.\nAmplifying the surrealism of his argument, JUSTICE\nBREYER uses the fact that many States have abandoned\ncapital punishment—have abandoned it precisely because\nof the costs those suspect decisions have imposed—to\nconclude that it is now “unusual.” Post, at 33–39. (A\ncaution to the reader: Do not use the creative arithmetic\nthat JUSTICE BREYER employs in counting the number of\nStates that use the death penalty when you prepare your\nnext tax return; outside the world of our Eighth Amend-\nment abolitionist-inspired jurisprudence, it will be regarded\nas more misrepresentation than math.)\n   If we were to travel down the path that JUSTICE BREYER\nsets out for us and once again consider the constitutionality\nof the death penalty, I would ask that counsel also brief\nwhether our cases that have abandoned the historical\nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, beginning with\nTrop, should be overruled. That case has caused more\nmischief to our jurisprudence, to our federal system, and\nto our society than any other that comes to mind. JUSTICE\nBREYER’s dissent is the living refutation of Trop’s assump-\ntion that this Court has the capacity to recognize “evolving\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Time and again, this Court has\nupheld that decision. And time and again, a vocal minor-\nity of this Court has insisted that things have “changed\nradically,” post, at 2, and has sought to replace the judg-\nments of the People with their own standards of decency.\n   Capital punishment presents moral questions that\nphilosophers, theologians, and statesmen have grappled\nwith for millennia. The Framers of our Constitution\ndisagreed bitterly on the matter. For that reason, they\nhandled it the same way they handled many other contro-\nversial issues: they left it to the People to decide. By\narrogating to himself the power to overturn that decision,\nJUSTICE BREYER does not just reject the death penalty, he\nrejects the Enlightenment.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

His conclusion is based on an analysis\nthat itself provides a powerful case against enforcing an\nimaginary constitutional rule against “arbitrariness.”\n   The thrust of JUSTICE BREYER’s argument is that empir-\nical studies performed by death penalty abolitionists\nreveal that the assignment of death sentences does not\nnecessarily correspond to the “egregiousness” of the\ncrimes, but instead appears to be correlated to “arbitrary”\nfactors, such as the locality in which the crime was com-\nmitted. Relying on these studies to determine the consti-\ntutionality of the death penalty fails to respect the values\nimplicit in the Constitution’s allocation of decisionmaking\nin this context. The Donohue study, on which JUSTICE\nBREYER relies most heavily, measured the “egregiousness”\n(or “deathworthiness”) of murders by asking lawyers to\nidentify the legal grounds for aggravation in each case,\nand by asking law students to evaluate written summaries\nof the murders and assign “egregiousness” scores based on\na rubric designed to capture and standardize their moral\njudgments.

This\nexercise in some ways approximates the function per-\nformed by jurors, but there is at least one critical differ-\nence: The law students make their moral judgments based\non written summaries—they do not sit through hours,\ndays, or weeks of evidence detailing the crime; they do not\nhave an opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses,\nto see the remorse of the defendant, to feel the impact of\nthe crime on the victim’s family; they do not bear the\nburden of deciding the fate of another human being; and\nthey are not drawn from the community whose sense of\nsecurity and justice may have been torn asunder by an act\nof callous disregard for human life. They are like appel-\n\f4                         GLOSSIP v.

III, §2, cl. 3.\nAnd the Sixth Amendment promises that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . .\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\nthe crime shall have been committed.” Those provisions\nensure that capital defendants are given the option to be\nsentenced by a jury of their peers who, collectively, are\nbetter situated to make the moral judgment between life\nand death than are the products of contemporary Ameri-\ncan law schools.\n   It should come as no surprise, then, that the primary\nexplanation a regression analysis revealed for the gap\nbetween the egregiousness scores and the actual sentences\nwas not the race or sex of the offender or victim, but the\nlocality in which the crime was committed.

See, e.g.,\nRing v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 614 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment) (arguing that “the Eighth Amendment requires that a jury,\nnot a judge, make the decision to sentence a defendant to death”);\nWainwright v.

The\nconstitutional provisions just quoted, which place such\ndecisions in the hands of jurors and trial courts located\nwhere “the crime shall have been committed,” seem delib-\nerately designed to introduce that factor.\n   In any event, the results of these studies are inherently\nunreliable because they purport to control for egregious-\nness by quantifying moral depravity in a process that is\nitself arbitrary, not to mention dehumanizing. One such\nstudy’s explanation of how the author assigned “depravity\npoints” to identify the “worst of the worst” murderers\nproves the point well. McCord, Lightning Still Strikes, 71\nBrooklyn L. Rev. 797, 833–834 (2005). Each aggravating\nfactor received a point value based on the “blame-\nworth[iness]” of the action associated with it. Id., at 830.\nKilling a prison guard, for instance, earned a defendant\nthree “depravity points” because it improved the case for\ncomplete incapacitation, while killing a police officer\nmerited only two, because, “considered dispassionately,”\nsuch acts do “not seem be a sine qua non of the worst\ncriminals.” Id., at 834–836. (Do not worry, the author\nreassures us, “many killers of police officers accrue de-\npravity points in other ways that clearly put them among\nthe worst criminals.” Id., at 836.) Killing a child under\nthe age of 12 was worth two depravity points, because\nsuch an act “seems particularly heartless,” but killing\nsomeone over the age of 70 earned the murderer only one,\nfor although “elderly victims tug at our hearts,” they do so\n“less” than children “because the promise of a long life is\nless.” Id., at 836, 838. Killing to make a political state-\nment was worth three depravity points; killing out of\nracial hatred, only two. Id., at 835, 837.

Infections from untreated wounds con-\ntributed to his other cause of death: pneumonia. Id., at\n*1–*2. And Johnny Shane Kormondy, who met his end on\nJanuary 15, 2015, did so after he and his two accomplices\ninvaded the home of a married couple, took turns raping\nthe wife and forcing her to perform oral sex at gunpoint—\nat one point, doing both simultaneously—and then put a\nbullet in her husband’s head during the final rape. Kor-\nmondy v. Secretary, Fla. Dept. of Corrections, 688 F. 3d\n1244, 1247–1248 (CA11 2012).\n   Some of our most “egregious” cases have been those in\nwhich we have granted relief based on an unfounded\nEighth Amendment claim. For example, we have granted\nrelief in a number of egregious cases based on this Court’s\ndecision in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), ex-\nempting certain “mentally retarded” offenders from the\ndeath penalty. Last Term, the Court granted relief to a\n\f8                     GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nman who kidnaped, beat, raped, and murdered a 21-year-\nold pregnant newlywed, Karol Hurst, also murdering her\nunborn child, and then, on the same day, murdered a\nsheriff ’s deputy acting in the line of duty. Hall v. Florida,\n572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). And in Atkins\nitself, the Court granted relief to a man who carjacked\nEric Michael Nesbitt, forced him to withdraw money from\na bank, drove him to a secluded area, and then shot him\nmultiple times before leaving him to bleed to death. At-\nkins v. Commonwealth, 257 Va. 160, 166–167, 510 S. E. 2d\n445, 449–450 (1999).\n   The Court has also misinterpreted the Eighth Amend-\nment to grant relief in egregious cases involving rape. In\nKennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407 (2008), the Court\ngranted relief to a man who had been sentenced to death\nfor raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The rape was so\nviolent that it “separated her cervix from the back of her\nvagina, causing her rectum to protrude into the vaginal\nstructure,” and tore her “entire perineum . . . from the\nposterior fourchette to the anus.” Id., at 414. The evi-\ndence indicated that the petitioner spent at least an hour\nand half attempting to destroy the evidence of his crime\nbefore seeking emergency assistance, even as his step-\ndaughter bled profusely from her injuries. Id., at 415.\nAnd in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality\nopinion), the Court granted relief to a petitioner who had\nescaped from prison, broken into the home of a young\nmarried couple and their newborn, forced the wife to bind\nher husband, gagged her husband with her underwear,\nraped her (even after being told that she was recovering\nfrom a recent childbirth), and then kidnaped her after\nthreatening her husband, Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555,\n556–557, 216 S. E. 2d 782, 786–787 (1975). In each case,\nthe Court crafted an Eighth Amendment right to be free\nfrom execution for the crime of rape—whether it be of an\nadult, Coker, 433 U. S., at 592, or a child, Kennedy, supra,\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

See Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005). Although the Court had\nrejected the claim less than two decades earlier, Stanford\nv. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), it decided to revisit the\nissue for a petitioner who had slain his victim because “he\nwanted to murder someone” and believed he could “get\naway with it” because he was a few months shy of his 18th\nbirthday. 543 U. S., at 556. His randomly chosen victim\nwas Shirley Crook, whom he and his friends kidnaped in\nthe middle of the night, bound with duct tape and electri-\ncal wire, and threw off a bridge to drown in the river\nbelow. Id., at 556–557. The State of Alabama’s brief in\nthat case warned the Court that its decision would free\nfrom death row a number of killers who had been sen-\ntenced for crimes committed as juveniles. Brief for State\nof Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae in Roper v. Simmons, O.\nT. 2014, No. 03–633. Mark Duke, for example, murdered\nhis father for refusing to loan him a truck, and his father’s\ngirlfriend and her two young daughters because he wanted\nno witnesses to the crime. Id., at 4. He shot his father\nand his father’s girlfriend pointblank in the face as they\npleaded for their lives. Id., at 5–6. He then tracked the\ngirls down in their hiding places and slit their throats,\nleaving them alive for several minutes as they drowned in\ntheir own blood. Id., at 6–7.\n   Whatever one’s views on the permissibility or wisdom of\nthe death penalty, I doubt anyone would disagree that\neach of these crimes was egregious enough to merit the\nseverest condemnation that society has to offer. The only\nconstitutional problem with the fact that these criminals\nwere spared that condemnation, while others were not, is\n\f10                         GLOSSIP v.

North\nCarolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion), may have introduced\nthe problem of arbitrary application. Post, at 14. I agree that Woodson\neliminated one reliable legislative response to concerns about arbitrari-\nness. Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 486 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring). Because that decision was also questionable on constitutional\ngrounds, id., at 486–488, I would be willing to revisit it in a future case.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

But rather than try to\npatch up the death penalty’s legal wounds one at a time, I\nwould ask for full briefing on a more basic question:\nwhether the death penalty violates the Constitution.\n   The relevant legal standard is the standard set forth in\nthe Eighth Amendment. The Constitution there forbids\nthe “inflict[ion]” of “cruel and unusual punishments.”\nAmdt. 8. The Court has recognized that a “claim that\npunishment is excessive is judged not by the standards\nthat prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over\nthe ‘Bloody Assizes’ or when the Bill of Rights was adopted,\nbut rather by those that currently prevail.” Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002). Indeed, the Constitu­\ntion prohibits various gruesome punishments that were\ncommon in Blackstone’s day. See 4 W. Blackstone, Com­\nmentaries on the Laws of England 369–370 (1769) (listing\nmutilation and dismembering, among other punishments).\n   Nearly 40 years ago, this Court upheld the death pen­\nalty under statutes that, in the Court’s view, contained\nsafeguards sufficient to ensure that the penalty would be\napplied reliably and not arbitrarily. See Gregg v. Georgia,\n428 U. S. 153, 187 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand Stevens, JJ.); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 247\n(1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.);\nJurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 268 (1976) (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); but cf. Woodson v.\nNorth Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 303 (1976) (plurality opin­\nion) (striking down mandatory death penalty); Roberts v.\nLouisiana, 428 U. S. 325, 331 (1976) (plurality opinion)\n(similar). The circumstances and the evidence of the\ndeath penalty’s application have changed radically since\nthen. Given those changes, I believe that it is now time to\nreopen the question.\n   In 1976, the Court thought that the constitutional in­\nfirmities in the death penalty could be healed; the Court in\neffect delegated significant responsibility to the States to\ndevelop procedures that would protect against those con­\nstitutional problems. Almost 40 years of studies, surveys,\nand experience strongly indicate, however, that this effort\nhas failed. Today’s administration of the death penalty\ninvolves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1)\nserious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and\n(3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death\npenalty’s penological purpose. Perhaps as a result, (4)\nmost places within the United States have abandoned its\nuse.\n   I shall describe each of these considerations, emphasiz­\ning changes that have occurred during the past four dec­\nades. For it is those changes, taken together with my own\n20 years of experience on this Court, that lead me to be­\nlieve that the death penalty, in and of itself, now likely\nconstitutes a legally prohibited “cruel and unusual pun­\nishmen[t].” U. S. Const., Amdt. 8.\n                             I\n                “Cruel”—Lack of Reliability\n  This Court has specified that the finality of death cre­\nates a “qualitative difference” between the death penalty\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand other punishments (including life in prison). Wood-\nson, 428 U. S., at 305 (plurality opinion). That “qualita­\ntive difference” creates “a corresponding difference in the\nneed for reliability in the determination that death is the\nappropriate punishment in a specific case.” Ibid. There is\nincreasing evidence, however, that the death penalty as\nnow applied lacks that requisite reliability. Cf. Kansas v.\nMarsh, 548 U. S. 163, 207–211 (2006) (Souter, J., dis­\nsenting) (DNA exonerations constitute “a new body of\nfact” when considering the constitutionality of capital\npunishment).\n   For one thing, despite the difficulty of investigating the\ncircumstances surrounding an execution for a crime that\ntook place long ago, researchers have found convincing\nevidence that, in the past three decades, innocent people\nhave been executed. See, e.g., Liebman, Fatal Injustice;\nCarlos DeLuna’s Execution Shows That a Faster, Cheaper\nDeath Penalty is a Dangerous Idea, L. A. Times, June 1,\n2012, p. A19 (describing results of a 4-year investigation,\nlater published as The Wrong Carlos: Anatomy of a\nWrongful Execution (2014), that led its authors to con­\nclude that Carlos DeLuna, sentenced to death and executed\nin 1989, six years after his arrest in Texas for stabbing\na single mother to death in a convenience store, was inno­\ncent); Grann, Trial By Fire: Did Texas Execute An Inno­\ncent Man? The New Yorker, Sept. 7, 2009, p. 42 (describ­\ning evidence that Cameron Todd Willingham was\nconvicted, and ultimately executed in 2004, for the appar­\nently motiveless murder of his three children as the result\nof invalid scientific analysis of the scene of the house fire\nthat killed his children). See also, e.g., Press Release: Gov.\nRitter Grants Posthumous Pardon in Case Dating Back to\n1930s, Jan. 7, 2011, p. 1 (Colorado Governor granted full\nand unconditional posthumous pardon to Joe Arridy, a\nman with an IQ of 46 who was executed in 1936, because,\naccording to the Governor, “an overwhelming body of\n\f4                    GLOSSIP v.

Warden, Wilkie\nCollins’s The Dead Alive: The Novel, the Case, and Wrong­\nful Convictions 157–158 (2005) (in 1987, Nebraska Gover­\nnor Bob Kerrey pardoned William Jackson Marion, who\nhad been executed a century earlier for the murder of\nJohn Cameron, a man who later turned up alive; the\nalleged victim, Cameron, had gone to Mexico to avoid a\nshotgun wedding).\n   For another, the evidence that the death penalty has\nbeen wrongly imposed (whether or not it was carried out),\nis striking. As of 2002, this Court used the word “disturb­\ning” to describe the number of instances in which individ­\nuals had been sentenced to death but later exonerated. At\nthat time, there was evidence of approximately 60\nexonerations in capital cases.       Atkins, 536 U. S., at\n320, n. 25; National Registry of Exonerations, online at\nhttp://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.\naspx (all Internet materials as visited June 25, 2015, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). (I use “exonera­\ntion” to refer to relief from all legal consequences of a\ncapital conviction through a decision by a prosecutor, a\nGovernor or a court, after new evidence of the defendant’s\ninnocence was discovered.) Since 2002, the number of\nexonerations in capital cases has risen to 115.

National Registry of Exonera­\ntions, Exonerations in 2014, p. 2 (2015).\n   The stories of three of the men exonerated within the\nlast year are illustrative. DNA evidence showed that\nHenry Lee McCollum did not commit the rape and murder\nfor which he had been sentenced to death. Katz & Eck­\nholm, DNA Evidence Clears Two Men in 1983 Murder,\nN. Y. Times, Sept. 3, 2014, p. A1. Last Term, this Court\nordered that Anthony Ray Hinton, who had been convicted\nof murder, receive further hearings in state court; he was\nexonerated earlier this year because the forensic evidence\nused against him was flawed. Hinton v. Alabama, 571\nU. S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Blinder, Alabama Man on\nDeath Row for Three Decades Is Freed as State’s Case\nErodes, N. Y. Times, Apr. 4, 2014, p. A11. And when\nGlenn Ford, also convicted of murder, was exonerated, the\nprosecutor admitted that even “[a]t the time this case was\ntried there was evidence that would have cleared Glenn\nFord.” Stroud, Lead Prosecutor Apologizes for Role in\nSending Man to Death Row, Shreveport Times, Mar. 27,\n2015. All three of these men spent 30 years on death row\nbefore being exonerated. I return to these examples infra.\n   Furthermore, exonerations occur far more frequently\nwhere capital convictions, rather than ordinary criminal\nconvictions, are at issue. Researchers have calculated that\ncourts (or State Governors) are 130 times more likely to\nexonerate a defendant where a death sentence is at issue.\nThey are nine times more likely to exonerate where a\ncapital murder, rather than a noncapital murder, is at\nissue. Exonerations 2012 Report 15–16, and nn. 24–26.\n   Why is that so? To some degree, it must be because the\nlaw that governs capital cases is more complex. To some\ndegree, it must reflect the fact that courts scrutinize capi­\ntal cases more closely. But, to some degree, it likely also\n\f6                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreflects a greater likelihood of an initial wrongful convic­\ntion. How could that be so? In the view of researchers\nwho have conducted these studies, it could be so because\nthe crimes at issue in capital cases are typically horren­\ndous murders, and thus accompanied by intense community\npressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a\nconviction. This pressure creates a greater likelihood of\nconvicting the wrong person. See Gross, Jacoby, Mathe-\nson, Montgomery, & Patil, Exonerations in the United\nStates 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. & C. 523, 531–\n533 (2005); Gross & O’Brien, Frequency and Predictors of\nFalse Conviction: Why We Know So Little, and New Data\non Capital Cases, 5 J. Empirical L. Studies 927, 956–957\n(2008) (noting that, in comparing those who were exoner­\nated from death row to other capital defendants who were\nnot so exonerated, the initial police investigations tended\nto be shorter for those exonerated); see also B. Garrett,\nConvicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go\nWrong (2011) (discussing other common causes of wrong­\nful convictions generally including false confessions, mis­\ntaken eyewitness testimony, untruthful jailhouse inform­\nants, and ineffective defense counsel).\n   In the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, for example,\nwho (as noted earlier) was executed despite likely inno­\ncence, the State Bar of Texas recently filed formal miscon­\nduct charges against the lead prosecutor for his actions—\nactions that may have contributed to Willingham’s convic­\ntion. Possley, Prosecutor Accused of Misconduct in Death\nPenalty Case, Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2015, p. A3. And\nin Glenn Ford’s case, the prosecutor admitted that he was\npartly responsible for Ford’s wrongful conviction, issuing a\npublic apology to Ford and explaining that, at the time of\nFord’s conviction, he was “not as interested in justice as\n[he] was in winning.” Stroud, supra.\n   Other factors may also play a role. One is the practice\nof death-qualification; no one can serve on a capital jury\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwho is not willing to impose the death penalty. See\nRozelle, The Principled Executioner: Capital Juries’ Bias\nand the Benefits of True Bifurcation, 38 Ariz. S. L. J. 769,\n772–793, 807 (2006) (summarizing research and conclud­\ning that “[f]or over fifty years, empirical investigation has\ndemonstrated that death qualification skews juries toward\nguilt and death”); Note, Mandatory Voir Dire Questions in\nCapital Cases: A Potential Solution to the Biases of Death\nQualification, 10 Roger Williams Univ. L. Rev. 211, 214–\n223 (2004) (similar).\n   Another is the more general problem of flawed forensic\ntestimony. See Garrett, supra, at 7. The Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI), for example, recently found that\nflawed microscopic hair analysis was used in 33 of 35\ncapital cases under review; 9 of the 33 had already been\nexecuted. FBI, National Press Releases, FBI Testimony\non Microscopic Hair Analysis Contained Errors in at Least\n90 Percent of Cases in Ongoing Review, Apr. 20, 2015.\nSee also Hsu, FBI Admits Errors at Trials: False Matches\non Crime-Scene Hair, Washington Post, Apr. 19, 2015,\np. A1 (in the District of Columbia, which does not have the\ndeath penalty, five of seven defendants in cases with\nflawed hair analysis testimony were eventually exonerated).\n   In light of these and other factors, researchers estimate\nthat about 4% of those sentenced to death are actually\ninnocent. See Gross, O’Brien, Hu, & Kennedy, Rate of\nFalse Conviction of Criminal Defendants Who Are Sen­\ntenced to Death, 111 Proceeding of the National Academy\nof Sciences 7230 (2014) (full-scale study of all death sen­\ntences from 1973 through 2004 estimating that 4.1% of\nthose sentenced to death are actually innocent); Risinger,\nInnocents Convicted: An Empirically Justified Factual\nWrongful Conviction Rate, 97 J. Crim. L. & C. 761 (2007)\n(examination of DNA exonerations in death penalty cases\nfor murder-rapes between 1982 and 1989 suggesting an\nanalogous rate of between 3.3% and 5%).\n\f8                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Finally, if we expand our definition of “exoneration”\n(which we limited to errors suggesting the defendant was\nactually innocent) and thereby also categorize as “errone­\nous” instances in which courts failed to follow legally\nrequired procedures, the numbers soar. Between 1973\nand 1995, courts identified prejudicial errors in 68% of the\ncapital cases before them. Gelman, Liebman, West, &\nKiss, A Broken System: The Persistent Patterns of Rever­\nsals of Death Sentences in the United States, 1 J. Empiri­\ncal L. Studies 209, 217 (2004). State courts on direct and\npostconviction review overturned 47% of the sentences\nthey reviewed. Id., at 232. Federal courts, reviewing\ncapital cases in habeas corpus proceedings, found error in\n40% of those cases. Ibid.\n  This research and these figures are likely controversial.\nFull briefing would allow us to scrutinize them with more\ncare. But, at a minimum, they suggest a serious problem\nof reliability. They suggest that there are too many in­\nstances in which courts sentence defendants to death\nwithout complying with the necessary procedures; and\nthey suggest that, in a significant number of cases, the\ndeath sentence is imposed on a person who did not commit\nthe crime. See Earley, A Pink Cadillac, An IQ of 63, and A\nFourteen-Year-Old from South Carolina: Why I Can No\nLonger Support the Death Penalty, 49 U. Rich. L. Rev.\n811, 813 (2015) (“I have come to the conclusion that the\ndeath penalty is based on a false utopian premise.

In sum, there is significantly more research-\nbased evidence today indicating that courts sentence to\ndeath individuals who may well be actually innocent or\nwhose convictions (in the law’s view) do not warrant the\ndeath penalty’s application.\n                             II\n                   “Cruel”—Arbitrariness\n   The arbitrary imposition of punishment is the antithesis\nof the rule of law. For that reason, Justice Potter Stewart\n(who supplied critical votes for the holdings in Furman v.\nGeorgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), and Gregg)\nfound the death penalty unconstitutional as administered\nin 1972:\n    “These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the\n    same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and\n    unusual. For, of all the people convicted of [death­\n    eligible crimes], many just as reprehensible as these,\n    the[se] petitioners are among a capriciously selected\n    random handful upon which the sentence of death has\n    in fact been imposed.” Furman, 408 U.

GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbe) unconstitutional if “inflicted in an arbitrary and capri­\ncious manner.” Gregg, 428 U. S., at 188 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); see also id., at 189\n(“[W]here discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a\nmatter so grave as the determination of whether a human\nlife should be taken or spared, that discretion must be\nsuitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of\nwholly arbitrary and capricious action”); Godfrey v. Geor­\ngia, 446 U. S. 420, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion) (similar).\n   The Court has consequently sought to make the applica­\ntion of the death penalty less arbitrary by restricting its\nuse to those whom Justice Souter called “ ‘the worst of the\nworst.’ ” Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U. S., at 206 (dissenting\nopinion); see also Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 568\n(2005) (“Capital punishment must be limited to those\noffenders who commit a narrow category of the most seri­\nous crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the\nmost deserving of execution” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 420 (2008)\n(citing Roper, supra, at 568).\n   Despite the Gregg Court’s hope for fair administration of\nthe death penalty, 40 years of further experience make it\nincreasingly clear that the death penalty is imposed arbi­\ntrarily, i.e., without the “reasonable consistency” legally\nnecessary to reconcile its use with the Constitution’s\ncommands. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112\n(1982).\n   Thorough studies of death penalty sentences support\nthis conclusion. A recent study, for example, examined all\ndeath penalty sentences imposed between 1973 and 2007\nin Connecticut, a State that abolished the death penalty in\n2012. Donohue, An Empirical Evaluation of the Connecti­\ncut Death Penalty System Since 1973: Are There Unlawful\nRacial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities? 11 J. Empiri­\ncal Legal Studies 637 (2014). The study reviewed treat­\nment of all homicide defendants. It found 205 instances in\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Courts imposed a death\nsentence in 12 of these 205 cases, of which 9 were sus­\ntained on appeal. Id., at 641. The study then measured\nthe “egregiousness” of the murderer’s conduct in those 9\ncases, developing a system of metrics designed to do so.\nId., at 643–645. It then compared the egregiousness of the\nconduct of the 9 defendants sentenced to death with the\negregiousness of the conduct of defendants in the remain­\ning 196 cases (those in which the defendant, though found\nguilty of a death-eligible offense, was ultimately not sen­\ntenced to death). Application of the studies’ metrics made\nclear that only 1 of those 9 defendants was indeed the\n“worst of the worst” (or was, at least, within the 15%\nconsidered most “egregious”). The remaining eight were\nnot. Their behavior was no worse than the behavior of at\nleast 33 and as many as 170 other defendants (out of a\ntotal pool of 205) who had not been sentenced to death.\nId., at 678–679.\n  Such studies indicate that the factors that most clearly\nought to affect application of the death penalty—namely,\ncomparative egregiousness of the crime—often do not.\nOther studies show that circumstances that ought not to\naffect application of the death penalty, such as race, gen­\nder, or geography, often do.\n  Numerous studies, for example, have concluded that\nindividuals accused of murdering white victims, as op­\nposed to black or other minority victims, are more likely to\nreceive the death penalty. See GAO, Report to the Senate\nand House Committees on the Judiciary: Death Penalty\nSentencing 5 (GAO/GGD–90–57, 1990) (82% of the 28\nstudies conducted between 1972 and 1990 found that race\nof victim influences capital murder charge or death sen­\ntence, a “finding . . . remarkably consistent across data\nsets, states, data collection methods, and analytic tech­\nniques”); Shatz & Dalton, Challenging the Death Penalty\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v.

Rev. 1227, 1245–1251 (2013)\n(same conclusion drawn from 20 plus studies conducted\nbetween 1990 and 2013).\n   Fewer, but still many, studies have found that the gen­\nder of the defendant or the gender of the victim makes a\nnot-otherwise-warranted difference. Id., at 1251–1253\n(citing many studies).\n   Geography also plays an important role in determining\nwho is sentenced to death. See id., at 1253–1256. And\nthat is not simply because some States permit the death\npenalty while others do not. Rather within a death pen­\nalty State, the imposition of the death penalty heavily de-\npends on the county in which a defendant is tried. Smith,\nThe Geography of the Death Penalty and its Ramifica­\ntions, 92 B. U. L. Rev. 227, 231–232 (2012) (hereinafter\nSmith); see also Donohue, supra, at 673 (“[T]he single\nmost important influence from 1973–2007 explaining\nwhether a death-eligible defendant [in Connecticut] would\nbe sentenced to death was whether the crime occurred in\nWaterbury [County]”). Between 2004 and 2009, for exam­\nple, just 29 counties (fewer than 1% of counties in the\ncountry) accounted for approximately half of all death\nsentences imposed nationwide. Smith 233. And in 2012,\njust 59 counties (fewer than 2% of counties in the country)\naccounted for all death sentences imposed nationwide.\nDPIC, The 2% Death Penalty: How A Minority of Counties\nProduce Most Death Cases At Enormous Costs to All 9\n(Oct. 2013).\n   What accounts for this county-by-county disparity?\nSome studies indicate that the disparity reflects the deci­\nsionmaking authority, the legal discretion, and ultimately\nthe power of the local prosecutor. See, e.g., Goelzhauser,\nProsecutorial Discretion Under Resource Constraints:\nBudget Allocations and Local Death-Charging Decisions,\n96 Judicature 161, 162–163 (2013); Barnes, Sloss, &\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Colo. L. Rev. 1069 (2013) (Colo-\nrado); Shatz & Dalton, supra, at 1260–1261 (Alameda\nCounty).\n   Others suggest that the availability of resources for\ndefense counsel (or the lack thereof) helps explain geo­\ngraphical differences. See, e.g., Smith 258–265 (counties\nwith higher death-sentencing rates tend to have weaker\npublic defense programs); Liebman & Clarke, Minority\nPractice, Majority’s Burden: The Death Penalty Today, 9\nOhio S. J. Crim. L. 255, 274 (2011) (hereinafter Liebman\n& Clarke) (similar); see generally Bright, Counsel for the\nPoor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime but for\nthe Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L. J. 1835 (1994).\n   Still others indicate that the racial composition of and\ndistribution within a county plays an important role. See,\ne.g., Levinson, Smith, & Young, Devaluing Death: An\nEmpirical Study of Implicit Racial Bias on Jury-Eligible\nCitizens in Six Death Penalty States, 89 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n513, 533–536 (2014) (summarizing research on this point);\nsee also Shatz & Dalton, supra, at 1275 (describing re­\nsearch finding that death-sentencing rates were lowest in\ncounties with the highest nonwhite population); cf. Cohen\n& Smith, The Racial Geography of the Federal Death\nPenalty, 85 Wash. L. Rev. 425 (2010) (arguing that the\nfederal death penalty is sought disproportionately where\nthe federal district, from which the jury will be drawn, has\na dramatic racial difference from the county in which the\nfederal crime occurred).\n   Finally, some studies suggest that political pressures,\nincluding pressures on judges who must stand for election,\n\f14                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncan make a difference. See Woodward v. Alabama, 571\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (slip op., at 7) (noting that empirical\nevidence suggests that, when Alabama judges reverse jury\nrecommendations, these “judges, who are elected in parti­\nsan proceedings, appear to have succumbed to electoral\npressures”); Harris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 519 (1995)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting) (similar); Gelman, 1 J. Empirical\nL. Studies, at 247 (elected state judges are less likely to\nreverse flawed verdicts in capital cases in small towns\nthan in larger communities).\n   Thus, whether one looks at research indicating that\nirrelevant or improper factors—such as race, gender, local\ngeography, and resources—do significantly determine who\nreceives the death penalty, or whether one looks at re­\nsearch indicating that proper factors—such as “egregious­\nness”—do not determine who receives the death penalty,\nthe legal conclusion must be the same: The research\nstrongly suggests that the death penalty is imposed\narbitrarily.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS catalogues the tragic details of various\ncapital cases, ante, at 6–10 (concurring opinion), but this\nmisses my point. Every murder is tragic, but unless we\nreturn to the mandatory death penalty struck down in\nWoodson, 428 U. S., at 304–305, the constitutionality of\ncapital punishment rests on its limited application to the\nworst of the worst, supra, at 9–10. And this extensive\nbody of evidence suggests that it is not so limited.\n   Four decades ago, the Court believed it possible to in­\nterpret the Eighth Amendment in ways that would signifi­\ncantly limit the arbitrary application of the death sen­\ntence. See Gregg, 428 U. S., at 195 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (“[T]he concerns ex­\npressed in Furman that the penalty of death not be im­\nposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met”).\nBut that no longer seems likely.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Constitution does not prohibit the use of prosecuto­\nrial discretion. Id., at 199, and n. 50 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); McCleskey v. Kemp,\n481 U. S. 279, 307–308, and n. 28, 311–312 (1987). It has\nnot proved possible to increase capital defense funding\nsignificantly. Smith, The Supreme Court and the Politics\nof Death, 94 Va. L. Rev. 283, 355 (2008) (“Capital defend­\ners are notoriously underfunded, particularly in states . . .\nthat lead the nation in executions”); American Bar Assn.\n(ABA) Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of\nDefense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, Guideline 9.1,\nCommentary (rev. ed. Feb. 2003), in 31 Hofstra L. Rev.\n913, 985 (2003) (“[C]ompensation of attorneys for death\npenalty representation remains notoriously inadequate”).\nAnd courts cannot easily inquire into judicial motivation.\nSee, e.g., Harris, supra.\n   Moreover, racial and gender biases may, unfortunately,\nreflect deeply rooted community biases (conscious or un­\nconscious), which, despite their legal irrelevance, may\naffect a jury’s evaluation of mitigating evidence, see\nCallins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1153 (1994) (Blackmun,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (“Perhaps it should\nnot be surprising that the biases and prejudices that infect\nsociety generally would influence the determination of\nwho is sentenced to death”). Nevertheless, it remains the\njury’s task to make the individualized assessment of\nwhether the defendant’s mitigation evidence entitles him\nto mercy. See, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319\n(1989); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604–605 (1978)\n(opinion of Burger, C. J.); Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304–305\n(plurality opinion).\n   Finally, since this Court held that comparative propor­\ntionality review is not constitutionally required, Pulley v.\nHarris, 465 U. S. 37 (1984), it seems unlikely that appeals\ncan prevent the arbitrariness I have described. See\nKaufman-Osborn, Capital Punishment, Proportionality\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nReview, and Claims of Fairness (with Lessons from Wash­\nington State), 79 Wash. L.

I see\ndiscrepancies for which I can find no rational explana­\ntions. Cf. Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 433 (plurality opinion)\n(“There is no principled way to distinguish this case, in\nwhich the death penalty was imposed, from the many\ncases in which it was not”). Why does one defendant who\ncommitted a single-victim murder receive the death pen­\nalty (due to aggravators of a prior felony conviction and an\nafter-the-fact robbery), while another defendant does not,\ndespite having kidnapped, raped, and murdered a young\nmother while leaving her infant baby to die at the scene of\nthe crime.

In\neach instance, the sentences compared were imposed in\nthe same State at about the same time.\n  The question raised by these examples (and the many\nmore I could give but do not), as well as by the research to\nwhich I have referred, is the same question Justice Stew­\nart, Justice Powell, and others raised over the course of\nseveral decades: The imposition and implementation of the\ndeath penalty seems capricious, random, indeed, arbi­\ntrary. From a defendant’s perspective, to receive that\nsentence, and certainly to find it implemented, is the\nequivalent of being struck by lightning. How then can we\nreconcile the death penalty with the demands of a Consti­\ntution that first and foremost insists upon a rule of law?\n                             III\n                  “Cruel”—Excessive Delays\n   The problems of reliability and unfairness almost inevi­\ntably lead to a third independent constitutional problem:\nexcessively long periods of time that individuals typically\nspend on death row, alive but under sentence of death.\nThat is to say, delay is in part a problem that the Consti­\ntution’s own demands create. Given the special need for\nreliability and fairness in death penalty cases, the Eighth\nAmendment does, and must, apply to the death penalty\n“with special force.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568. Those who\nface “that most severe sanction must have a fair oppor­\ntunity to show that the Constitution prohibits their execu­\ntion.” Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n22). At the same time, the Constitution insists that “every\n\f18                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsafeguard” be “observed” when “a defendant’s life is at\nstake.” Gregg, 428 U. S., at 187 (joint opinion of Stewart,\nPowell, and Stevens, JJ.); Furman, 408 U. S., at 306\n(Stewart, J., concurring) (death “differs from all other\nforms of criminal punishment, not in degree but in kind”);\nWoodson, supra, at 305 (plurality opinion) (“Death, in its\nfinality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100­\nyear prison term differs from one of only a year or two”).\n   These procedural necessities take time to implement.\nAnd, unless we abandon the procedural requirements that\nassure fairness and reliability, we are forced to confront\nthe problem of increasingly lengthy delays in capital cases.\nUltimately, though these legal causes may help to explain,\nthey do not mitigate the harms caused by delay itself.\n                             A\n   Consider first the statistics. In 2014, 35 individuals\nwere executed. Those executions occurred, on average,\nnearly 18 years after a court initially pronounced its\nsentence of death. DPIC, Execution List 2014, online\nat http: / / www.deathpenaltyinfo.org / execution - list-2014\n(showing an average delay of 17 years, 7 months). In some\ndeath penalty States, the average delay is longer. In\nan oral argument last year, for example, the State admit­\nted that the last 10 prisoners executed in Florida had\nspent an average of nearly 25 years on death row before\nexecution. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Hall v. Florida, O. T. 2013,\nNo. 12–10882, p. 46.\n   The length of the average delay has increased dramati­\ncally over the years. In 1960, the average delay between\nsentencing and execution was two years. See Aarons, Can\nInordinate Delay Between a Death Sentence and Execu­\ntion Constitute Cruel and Unusual Punishment? 29 Seton\nHall L. Rev. 147, 181 (1998). Ten years ago (in 2004) the\naverage delay was about 11 years. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), T. Snell, Capital Pun­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

By last year the\naverage had risen to about 18 years. DPIC, Execution List\n2014, supra. Nearly half of the 3,000 inmates now on\ndeath row have been there for more than 15 years. And,\nat present execution rates, it would take more than 75\nyears to carry out those 3,000 death sentences; thus, the\naverage person on death row would spend an additional\n37.5 years there before being executed. BJS 2013 Stats, at\n14, 18 (Tables 11 and 15).\n  I cannot find any reasons to believe the trend will soon\nbe reversed.\n                             B\n  These lengthy delays create two special constitutional\ndifficulties. See Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1069\n(2009) (Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certio­\nrari). First, a lengthy delay in and of itself is especially\ncruel because it “subjects death row inmates to decades of\nespecially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confine­\nment.” Ibid.; Gomez v. Fierro, 519 U. S. 918 (1996) (Ste­\nvens, J., dissenting) (excessive delays from sentencing to\nexecution can themselves “constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment”); see\nalso Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (memorandum\nof Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); Knight v.\nFlorida, 528 U. S. 990, 993 (1999) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of certiorari). Second, lengthy delay under­\nmines the death penalty’s penological rationale. Johnson,\nsupra, at 1069; Thompson v. McNeil, 556 U. S. 1114,\n1115 (2009) (statement of Stevens, J., respecting denial of\ncertiorari).\n                            1\n  Turning to the first constitutional difficulty, nearly all\ndeath penalty States keep death row inmates in isolation\n\f20                   GLOSSIP v.

American Civil Liberties\nUnion (ACLU), A Death Before Dying: Solitary Confine­\nment on Death Row 5 (July 2013) (ACLU Report). This\noccurs even though the ABA has suggested that death row\ninmates be housed in conditions similar to the general\npopulation, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on\nTorture has called for a global ban on solitary confinement\nlonger than 15 days. See id., at 2, 4; ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners 6 (3d ed. 2011).\nAnd it is well documented that such prolonged solitary\nconfinement produces numerous deleterious harms. See,\ne.g., Haney, Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Solitary\nand “Supermax” Confinement, 49 Crime & Delinquency\n124, 130 (2003) (cataloguing studies finding that solitary\nconfinement can cause prisoners to experience “anxiety,\npanic, rage, loss of control, paranoia, hallucinations, and\nself-mutilations,” among many other symptoms); Grassian,\nPsychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash\nU. J. L. & Policy 325, 331 (2006) (“[E]ven a few days of\nsolitary confinement will predictably shift the [brain’s]\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) pattern toward an abnormal\npattern characteristic of stupor and delirium”); accord, In\nre Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 167–168 (1890); see also Davis v.\nAyala, ante, at 1–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   The dehumanizing effect of solitary confinement is\naggravated by uncertainty as to whether a death sentence\nwill in fact be carried out. In 1890, this Court recognized\nthat, “when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is\nconfined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the\nsentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can\nbe subjected during that time is the uncertainty during\nthe whole of it.” Medley, supra, at 172. The Court was\nthere describing a delay of a mere four weeks. In the past\ncentury and a quarter, little has changed in this respect—\nexcept for duration. Today we must describe delays meas­\nured, not in weeks, but in decades. Supra, at 18–19.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Capi­\n\f24                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntal punishment by definition does not rehabilitate. It\ndoes, of course, incapacitate the offender. But the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates. See Ring\nv. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 615 (2002) (BREYER, J., concur­\nring in judgment).\n   Thus, as the Court has recognized, the death penalty’s\npenological rationale in fact rests almost exclusively upon\na belief in its tendency to deter and upon its ability to\nsatisfy a community’s interest in retribution. See, e.g.,\nGregg, 428 U. S., at 183 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,\nand Stevens, JJ.). Many studies have examined the death\npenalty’s deterrent effect; some have found such an effect,\nwhereas others have found a lack of evidence that it deters\ncrime. Compare ante, at 5 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (collect­\ning studies finding deterrent effect), with e.g., Sorensen,\nWrinkle, Brewer, & Marquart, Capital Punishment and\nDeterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder\nin Texas, 45 Crime & Delinquency 481 (1999) (no evidence\nof a deterrent effect); Bonner & Fessenden, Absence of\nExecutions: A Special Report, States With No Death Pen­\nalty Share Lower Homicide Rates, N. Y. Times, Sept. 22,\n2000, p.

National Research Council, Deterrence and the\nDeath Penalty 2 (D. Nagin & J. Pepper eds. 2012); accord,\nBaze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 79 (2008) (Stevens, J., concur­\nring in judgment) (“Despite 30 years of empirical re-\nsearch in the area, there remains no reliable statistical evi­\n\ndence that capital punishment in fact deters potential\noffenders”).\n   I recognize that a “lack of evidence” for a proposition\ndoes not prove the contrary. See Ring, supra, at 615 (one\nmight believe the studies “inconclusive”). But suppose\nthat we add to these studies the fact that, today, very few\nof those sentenced to death are actually executed, and that\neven those executions occur, on average, after nearly two\ndecades on death row. DPIC, Execution List 2014, supra.\nThen, does it still seem likely that the death penalty has a\nsignificant deterrent effect?\n   Consider, for example, what actually happened to the\n183 inmates sentenced to death in 1978. As of 2013 (35\nyears later), 38 (or 21% of them) had been executed; 132\n(or 72%) had had their convictions or sentences overturned\nor commuted; and 7 (or 4%) had died of other (likely natu­\nral) causes. Six (or 3%) remained on death row. BJS 2013\nStats, at 19 (Table 16).\n   The example illustrates a general trend. Of the 8,466\ninmates under a death sentence at some point between\n1973 and 2013, 16% were executed, 42% had their convic­\ntions or sentences overturned or commuted, and 6% died\nby other causes; the remainder (35%) are still on death\nrow. Id., at 20 (Table 17); see also Baumgartner & Die­\ntrich, Most Death Penalty Sentences Are Overturned:\nHere’s Why That Matters, Washington Post Blog, Monkey\nCage, Mar. 17, 2015 (similar).\n\f26                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Thus an offender who is sentenced to death is two or\nthree times more likely to find his sentence overturned or\ncommuted than to be executed; and he has a good chance\nof dying from natural causes before any execution (or\nexoneration) can take place. In a word, executions are\nrare. And an individual contemplating a crime but evalu­\nating the potential punishment would know that, in any\nevent, he faces a potential sentence of life without parole.\n   These facts, when recurring, must have some offsetting\neffect on a potential perpetrator’s fear of a death penalty.\nAnd, even if that effect is no more than slight, it makes it\ndifficult to believe (given the studies of deterrence cited\nearlier) that such a rare event significantly deters horren­\ndous crimes. See Furman, 408 U. S., at 311–312 (White,\nJ., concurring) (It cannot “be said with confidence that\nsociety’s need for specific deterrence justifies death for so\nfew when for so many in like circumstances life imprison­\nment or shorter prison terms are judged sufficient”).\n   But what about retribution? Retribution is a valid\npenological goal. I recognize that surviving relatives of\nvictims of a horrendous crime, or perhaps the community\nitself, may find vindication in an execution. And a com­\nmunity that favors the death penalty has an understand-\nable interest in representing their voices. But see A. Sarat,\nMercy on Trial: What It Means To Stop an Execution 130\n(2005) (Illinois Governor George Ryan explained his deci­\nsion to commute all death sentences on the ground that it\nwas “cruel and unusual” for “family members to go\nthrough this . . . legal limbo for [20] years”).\n   The relevant question here, however, is whether a\n“community’s sense of retribution” can often find vindica­\ntion in “a death that comes,” if at all, “only several decades\nafter the crime was committed.” Valle v. Florida, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of\nstay) (slip op., at 3). By then the community is a different\ngroup of people. The offenders and the victims’ families\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave grown far older. Feelings of outrage may have sub­\nsided. The offender may have found himself a changed\nhuman being. And sometimes repentance and even for­\ngiveness can restore meaning to lives once ruined. At the\nsame time, the community and victims’ families will know\nthat, even without a further death, the offender will serve\ndecades in prison under a sentence of life without parole.\n  I recognize, of course, that this may not always be the\ncase, and that sometimes the community believes that an\nexecution could provide closure. Nevertheless, the delays\nand low probability of execution must play some role in\nany calculation that leads a community to insist on death\nas retribution. As I have already suggested, they may well\nattenuate the community’s interest in retribution to the\npoint where it cannot by itself amount to a significant\njustification for the death penalty. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). In any event, I believe that whatever interest in retri­\nbution might be served by the death penalty as currently\nadministered, that interest can be served almost as well\nby a sentence of life in prison without parole (a sentence\nthat every State now permits, see ACLU, A Living Death:\nLife Without Parole for Nonviolent Offenses 11, and n. 10\n(2013)).\n  Finally, the fact of lengthy delays undermines any effort\nto justify the death penalty in terms of its prevalence\nwhen the Founders wrote the Eighth Amendment. When\nthe Founders wrote the Constitution, there were no 20- or\n30-year delays. Execution took place soon after sentenc­\ning. See P. Mackey, Hanging in the Balance: The Anti-\nCapital Punishment Movement in New York State, 1776–\n1861, p. 17 (1982); T. Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning\nCrimes and Punishments (1779), reprinted in The Com­\nplete Jefferson 90, 95 (S. Padover ed. 1943); 2 Papers of\nJohn Marshall 207–209 (C. Cullen & H. Johnson eds.\n1977) (describing petition for commutation based in part\non 5-month delay); Pratt v. Attorney Gen. of Jamaica,\n\f28                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n[1994] 2 A. C., at 17 (same in United Kingdom) (collecting\ncases). And, for reasons I shall describe, infra, at 29–33,\nwe cannot return to the quick executions in the founding\nera.\n                               3\n   The upshot is that lengthy delays both aggravate the\ncruelty of the death penalty and undermine its jurispru­\ndential rationale. And this Court has said that, if the\ndeath penalty does not fulfill the goals of deterrence or\nretribution, “it is nothing more than the purposeless and\nneedless imposition of pain and suffering and hence an\nunconstitutional punishment.” Atkins, 536 U. S., at 319\n(quoting Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 798 (1982);\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Gregg, 428\nU. S., at 183 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Ste­\nvens, JJ.) (“sanction imposed cannot be so totally without\npenological justification that it results in the gratuitous\ninfliction of suffering”); Furman, supra, at 312 (White, J.,\nconcurring) (a “penalty with such negligible returns to the\nState would be patently excessive and cruel and unusual\npunishment violative of the Eighth Amendment”); Thomp­\nson, 556 U. S., at 1115 (statement of Stevens, J., respect­\ning denial of certiorari) (similar).\n   Indeed, Justice Lewis Powell (who provided a crucial\nvote in Gregg) came to much the same conclusion, albeit\nafter his retirement from this Court. Justice Powell had\ncome to the Court convinced that the Federal Constitution\ndid not outlaw the death penalty but rather left the matter\nup to individual States to determine. Furman, supra, at\n431–432 (Powell, J., dissenting); see also J. Jeffries, Jus­\ntice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., p. 409 (2001) (describing Powell,\nduring his time on the Court, as a “fervent partisan” of\n“the constitutionality of capital punishment”).\n   Soon after Justice Powell’s retirement, Chief Justice\nRehnquist appointed him to chair a committee addressing\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           29\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconcerns about delays in capital cases, the Ad Hoc Com­\nmittee on Federal Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases (Com­\nmittee). The Committee presented a report to Congress,\nand Justice Powell testified that “[d]elay robs the penalty\nof much of its deterrent value.” Habeas Corpus Reform,\nHearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n100th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 35 (1989 and 1990). Justice\nPowell, according to his official biographer, ultimately\nconcluded that capital punishment:\n    “ ‘serves no useful purpose.’ The United States was\n    ‘unique among the industrialized nations of the West\n    in maintaining the death penalty,’ and it was enforced\n    so rarely that it could not deter. More important, the\n    haggling and delay and seemingly endless litigation in\n    every capital case brought the law itself into disre­\n    pute.” Jeffries, supra, at 452.\nIn short, the problem of excessive delays led Justice Pow­\nell, at least in part, to conclude that the death penalty was\nunconstitutional.\n   As I have said, today delays are much worse. When\nChief Justice Rehnquist appointed Justice Powell to the\nCommittee, the average delay between sentencing and\nexecution was 7 years and 11 months, compared with 17\nyears and 7 months today. Compare BJS, L. Greenfeld,\nCapital Punishment, 1990, p. 11 (Table 12) (Sept. 1991)\nwith supra, at 18–19.\n                             C\n  One might ask, why can Congress or the States not deal\ndirectly with the delay problem? Why can they not take\nsteps to shorten the time between sentence and execution,\nand thereby mitigate the problems just raised? The an­\nswer is that shortening delay is much more difficult than\none might think. And that is in part because efforts to do\nso risk causing procedural harms that also undermine the\n\f30                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndeath penalty’s constitutionality.\n   For one thing, delays have helped to make application of\nthe death penalty more reliable. Recall the case of Henry\nLee McCollum, whom DNA evidence exonerated 30 years\nafter his conviction. Katz & Eckholm, N. Y. Times, at A1.\nIf McCollum had been executed earlier, he would not have\nlived to see the day when DNA evidence exonerated him\nand implicated another man; that man is already serving\na life sentence for a rape and murder that he committed\njust a few weeks after the murder McCollum was convicted\nof. Ibid. In fact, this Court had earlier denied review\nof McCollum’s claim over the public dissent of only one\nJustice. McCollum v. North Carolina, 512 U. S. 1254\n(1994). And yet a full 20 years after the Court denied\nreview, McCollum was exonerated by DNA evidence.\nThere are a significant number of similar cases, some of\nwhich I have discussed earlier. See also DPIC Innocence\nList, supra (Nathson Fields, 23 years; Paul House, 23\nyears; Nicholas Yarris, 21 years; Anthony Graves, 16\nyears; Damon Thibodeaux, 15 years; Ricky Jackson, Wiley\nBridgeman, and Kwame Ajamu, all exonerated for the\nsame crime 39 years after their convictions).\n   In addition to those who are exonerated on the ground\nthat they are innocent, there are other individuals whose\nsentences or convictions have been overturned for other\nreasons (as discussed above, state and federal courts found\nerror in 68% of the capital cases they reviewed between\n1973 and 1995). See Part I, supra. In many of these\ncases, a court will have found that the individual did not\nmerit the death penalty in a special sense—namely, he\nfailed to receive all the procedural protections that the law\nrequires for the death penalty’s application. By eliminat­\ning some of these protections, one likely could reduce\ndelay.     But which protections should we eliminate?\nShould we eliminate the trial-related protections we have\nestablished for capital defendants: that they be able to\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

S. 153; that the State provide adequate\ncounsel and, where warranted, adequate expert assis­\ntance, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932); Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U. S. 510 (2003); Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S.\n68 (1985); or that a jury must find the aggravating factors\nnecessary to impose the death penalty, Ring, 536 U. S.\n584; see also id., at 614 (BREYER, J., concurring in judg­\nment)? Should we no longer ensure that the State does\nnot execute those who are seriously intellectually disabled,\nAtkins, 536 U. S. 304? Should we eliminate the require­\nment that the manner of execution be constitutional, Baze,\n553 U. S. 35, or the requirement that the inmate be men­\ntally competent at the time of his execution, Ford v.\nWainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986)? Or should we get rid of\nthe criminal protections that all criminal defendants\nreceive—for instance, that defendants claiming violation\nof constitutional guarantees (say “due process of law”) may\nseek a writ of habeas corpus in federal courts? See, e.g.,\nO’Neal v. McAninch, 513 U. S. 432 (1995). My answer to\nthese questions is “surely not.” But see ante, at 5–7\n(SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   One might, of course, argue that courts, particularly\nfederal courts providing additional layers of review, apply\nthese and other requirements too strictly, and that causes\ndelay. But, it is difficult for judges, as it would be difficult\nfor anyone, not to apply legal requirements punctiliously\nwhen the consequence of failing to do so may well be\ndeath, particularly the death of an innocent person. See,\ne.g., Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 885 (1983)\n(“[A]lthough not every imperfection in the deliberative\nprocess is sufficient, even in a capital case, to set aside a\nstate-court judgment, the severity of the sentence man­\n\f32                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndates careful scrutiny in the review of any colorable claim\nof error”); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 422 (1995)\n(“[O]ur duty to search for constitutional error with pains­\ntaking care is never more exacting than it is in a capital\ncase” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Thompson, 556\nU. S., at 1116 (statement of Stevens, J.) (“Judicial process\ntakes time, but the error rate in capital cases illustrates\nits necessity”).\n   Moreover, review by courts at every level helps to en­\nsure reliability; if this Court had not ordered that Anthony\nRay Hinton receive further hearings in state court, see\nHinton v. Alabama, 571 U. S. ___, he may well have been\nexecuted rather than exonerated. In my own view, our\nlegal system’s complexity, our federal system with its\nseparate state and federal courts, our constitutional guar­\nantees, our commitment to fair procedure, and, above all,\na special need for reliability and fairness in capital cases,\ncombine to make significant procedural “reform” unlikely\nin practice to reduce delays to an acceptable level.\n   And that fact creates a dilemma: A death penalty sys­\ntem that seeks procedural fairness and reliability brings\nwith it delays that severely aggravate the cruelty of capi­\ntal punishment and significantly undermine the rationale\nfor imposing a sentence of death in the first place. See\nKnight, 528 U. S., at 998 (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (one of the primary causes of the delay\nis the States’ “failure to apply constitutionally sufficient\nprocedures at the time of initial [conviction or] sentenc­\ning”). But a death penalty system that minimizes delays\nwould undermine the legal system’s efforts to secure relia­\nbility and procedural fairness.\n   In this world, or at least in this Nation, we can have a\ndeath penalty that at least arguably serves legitimate\npenological purposes or we can have a procedural system\nthat at least arguably seeks reliability and fairness in the\ndeath penalty’s application. We cannot have both. And\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Last year, in 2014, only seven States\ncarried out an execution. Perhaps more importantly, in\nthe last two decades, the imposition and implementation\nof the death penalty have increasingly become unusual. I\ncan illustrate the significant decline in the use of the\ndeath penalty in several ways.\n   An appropriate starting point concerns the trajectory of\nthe number of annual death sentences nationwide, from\nthe 1970’s to present day. In 1977—just after the Su­\npreme Court made clear that, by modifying their legisla­\ntion, States could reinstate the death penalty—137 people\nwere sentenced to death. BJS 2013 Stats, at 19 (Table 16).\nMany States having revised their death penalty laws to\nmeet Furman’s requirements, the number of death sen­\ntences then increased. Between 1986 and 1999, 286 per­\nsons on average were sentenced to death each year. BJS\n2013 Stats, at 14, 19 (Tables 11 and 16). But, approxi­\nmately 15 years ago, the numbers began to decline, and\nthey have declined rapidly ever since. See Appendix A,\ninfra (showing sentences from 1977–2014). In 1999, 279\n\f34                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npersons were sentenced to death. BJS 2013 Stats, at 19\n(Table 16). Last year, just 73 persons were sentenced to\ndeath. DPIC, The Death Penalty in 2014: Year End Re­\nport 1 (2015).\n  That trend, a significant decline in the last 15 years,\nalso holds true with respect to the number of annual\nexecutions. See Appendix B, infra (showing executions\nfrom 1977–2014). In 1999, 98 people were executed. BJS,\nData Collection: National Prisoner Statistics Program\n(BJS Prisoner Statistics) (available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Last year, that number was only 35. DPIC, The\nDeath Penalty in 2014, supra, at 1.\n  Next, one can consider state-level data. Often when\ndeciding whether a punishment practice is, constitutionally\nspeaking, “unusual,” this Court has looked to the num-\nber of States engaging in that practice. Atkins, 536 U. S.,\nat 313–316; Roper, supra, at 564–566. In this respect, the\nnumber of active death penalty States has fallen dramati­\ncally. In 1972, when the Court decided Furman, the death\npenalty was lawful in 41 States. Nine States had abol­\nished it. E. Mandery, A Wild Justice: The Death and\nResurrection of Capital Punishment in America 145\n(2013). As of today, 19 States have abolished the death\npenalty (along with the District of Columbia), although\nsome did so prospectively only. See DPIC, States With\nand Without the Death Penalty, online at http://www.\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty. In\n11 other States that maintain the death penalty on the\nbooks, no execution has taken place for more than eight\nyears: Arkansas (last execution 2005); California (2006);\nColorado (1997); Kansas (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); Montana (2006); Nevada\n(2006); New Hampshire (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); North Carolina (2006);\nOregon (1997); Pennsylvania (1999); and Wyoming (1992).\nDPIC, Executions by State and Year, online at http://www.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          35\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/node/5741.\n   Accordingly, 30 States have either formally abolished\nthe death penalty or have not conducted an execution in\nmore than eight years. Of the 20 States that have con­\nducted at least one execution in the past eight years, 9\nhave conducted fewer than five in that time, making an\nexecution in those States a fairly rare event. BJS Prisoner\nStatistics (Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington).            That\nleaves 11 States in which it is fair to say that capital\npunishment is not “unusual.” And just three of those\nStates (Texas, Missouri, and Florida) accounted for 80% of\nthe executions nationwide (28 of the 35) in 2014. See\nDPIC, Number of Executions by State and Region Since\n1976, online at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/number­\n\nexecutions-state-and-region-1976. Indeed, last year, only\nseven States conducted an execution. DPIC, Executions\nby State and Year, supra; DPIC, Death Sentences in the\nUnited States From 1977 by State and by Year, online at\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-sentences-united­\nstates-1977-2008. In other words, in 43 States, no one was\nexecuted.\n   In terms of population, if we ask how many Americans\nlive in a State that at least occasionally carries out an\nexecution (at least one within the prior three years), the\nanswer two decades ago was 60% or 70%. Today, that\nnumber is 33%. See Appendix C, infra.\n   At the same time, use of the death penalty has become\nincreasingly concentrated geographically.       County-by­\ncounty figures are relevant, for decisions to impose the\ndeath penalty typically take place at a county level. See\nsupra, at 12–13. County-level sentencing figures show\nthat, between 1973 and 1997, 66 of America’s 3,143 coun­\nties accounted for approximately 50% of all death sentences\nimposed. Liebman & Clarke 264–265; cf. id., at 266.\n(counties with 10% of the Nation’s population imposed\n\f36                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n43% of its death sentences). By the early 2000’s, the death\npenalty was only actively practiced in a very small number\nof counties: between 2004 and 2009, only 35 counties\nimposed 5 or more death sentences, i.e., approximately one\nper year. See Appendix D, infra (such counties colored in\nred) (citing Ford, The Death Penalty’s Last Stand, The\nAtlantic, Apr. 21, 2015). And more recent data show that\nthe practice has diminished yet further: between 2010 and\n2015 (as of June 22), only 15 counties imposed five or more\ndeath sentences. See Appendix E, infra. In short, the\nnumber of active death penalty counties is small and\ngetting smaller. And the overall statistics on county-level\nexecutions bear this out. Between 1976 and 2007, there\nwere no executions in 86% of America’s counties. Liebman\n& Clarke 265–266, and n. 47; cf. ibid. (counties with less\nthan 5% of the Nation’s population carried out over half of\nits executions from 1976–2007).\n   In sum, if we look to States, in more than 60% there is\neffectively no death penalty, in an additional 18% an\nexecution is rare and unusual, and 6%, i.e., three States,\naccount for 80% of all executions. If we look to population,\nabout 66% of the Nation lives in a State that has not\ncarried out an execution in the last three years. And if we\nlook to counties, in 86% there is effectively no death pen-\nalty. It seems fair to say that it is now unusual to find\ncapital punishment in the United States, at least when we\nconsider the Nation as a whole. See Furman, 408 U. S., at\n311 (1972) (White, J., concurring) (executions could be so\ninfrequently carried out that they “would cease to be a\ncredible deterrent or measurably to contribute to any\nother end of punishment in the criminal justice system . . .\nwhen imposition of the penalty reaches a certain degree\nof infrequency, it would be very doubtful that any exist-\ning general need for retribution would be measurably\nsatisfied”).\n   Moreover, we have said that it “ ‘is not so much the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          37\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnumber of these States that is significant, but the con­\nsistency of the direction of change.’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at\n566 (quoting Atkins, supra, at 315) (finding significant\nthat five States had abandoned the death penalty for\njuveniles, four legislatively and one judicially, since the\nCourt’s decision in Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361\n(1989)). Judged in that way, capital punishment has\nindeed become unusual. Seven States have abolished the\ndeath penalty in the last decade, including (quite recently)\nNebraska. DPIC, States With and Without the Death\nPenalty, supra. And several States have come within a\nsingle vote of eliminating the death penalty. Seelye,\nMeasure to Repeal Death Penalty Fails by a Single Vote in\nNew Hampshire Senate, N. Y.

Eleven\nStates, as noted earlier, have not executed anyone in eight\nyears. Supra, at 34–35. And several States have formally\nstopped executing inmates. See Yardley, Oregon’s Gover­\nnor Says He Will Not Allow Executions, N. Y. Times, Nov.\n23, 2011, p.

In the\npast two decades, no State without a death penalty has\npassed legislation to reinstate the penalty. See Atkins,\nsupra, at 315–316; DPIC, States With and Without the\nDeath Penalty, supra. Indeed, even in many States most\nassociated with the death penalty, remarkable shifts have\n\f38                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noccurred. In Texas, the State that carries out the most\nexecutions, the number of executions fell from 40 in 2000\nto 10 in 2014, and the number of death sentences fell from\n48 in 1999 to 9 in 2013 (and 0 thus far in 2015).

Similarly\ndramatic declines are present in Virginia, Oklahoma,\nMissouri, and North Carolina. BJS 1999 Stats, at 6 (Table\n5); BJS 2013 Stats, at 19 (Table 16).\n  These circumstances perhaps reflect the fact that a\nmajority of Americans, when asked to choose between the\ndeath penalty and life in prison without parole, now\nchoose the latter.

Why should we not leave the\nmatter up to the people acting democratically through\nlegislatures? The Constitution foresees a country that will\nmake most important decisions democratically. Most\nnations that have abandoned the death penalty have done\nso through legislation, not judicial decision. And legisla­\ntors, unlike judges, are free to take account of matters\nsuch as monetary costs, which I do not claim are relevant\nhere.

They concern the infliction—\nindeed the unfair, cruel, and unusual infliction—of a\nserious punishment upon an individual. I recognize that\nin 1972 this Court, in a sense, turned to Congress and the\nstate legislatures in its search for standards that would\nincrease the fairness and reliability of imposing a death\npenalty. The legislatures responded. But, in the last four\ndecades, considerable evidence has accumulated that\nthose responses have not worked.\n   Thus we are left with a judicial responsibility. The\nEighth Amendment sets forth the relevant law, and we\nmust interpret that law. See Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 177 (1803); Hall, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19) (“That exercise of independent judgment is the Court’s\njudicial duty”).

The State plans to execute petitioners using\nthree drugs: midazolam, rocuronium bromide, and potas­\nsium chloride. The latter two drugs are intended to para­\nlyze the inmate and stop his heart. But they do so in a\ntorturous manner, causing burning, searing pain. It is\nthus critical that the first drug, midazolam, do what it is\nsupposed to do, which is to render and keep the inmate\nunconscious. Petitioners claim that midazolam cannot be\nexpected to perform that function, and they have presented\nample evidence showing that the State’s planned use of\nthis drug poses substantial, constitutionally intolerable\nrisks.\n   Nevertheless, the Court today turns aside petitioners’\nplea that they at least be allowed a stay of execution while\nthey seek to prove midazolam’s inadequacy. The Court\nachieves this result in two ways: first, by deferring to the\nDistrict Court’s decision to credit the scientifically unsup­\nported and implausible testimony of a single expert wit­\nness; and second, by faulting petitioners for failing to\nsatisfy the wholly novel requirement of proving the avail­\nability of an alternative means for their own executions.\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v.

At that time, Kentucky, like at least 29 of\nthe 35 other States with the death penalty, utilized a\nseries of three drugs to perform executions: (1) sodium\nthiopental, a “fast-acting barbiturate sedative that induces\na deep, comalike unconsciousness when given in the\namounts used for lethal injection”; (2) pancuronium bro­\nmide, “a paralytic agent that inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and . . . stops respiration”; and (3) potassium\nchloride, which “interferes with the electrical signals that\nstimulate the contractions of the heart, inducing cardiac\narrest.” Id., at 44 (plurality opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).\n   In Baze, it was undisputed that absent a “proper dose of\nsodium thiopental,” there would be a “substantial, consti­\ntutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the admin­\nistration of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injec­\ntion of potassium chloride.” Id., at 53. That is because, if\ngiven to a conscious inmate, pancuronium bromide would\nleave him or her asphyxiated and unable to demonstrate\n“any outward sign of distress,” while potassium chloride\nwould cause “excruciating pain.” Id., at 71 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). But the Baze petitioners conceded\nthat if administered as intended, Kentucky’s method of\nexecution would nevertheless “result in a humane death,”\nid., at 41 (plurality opinion), as the “proper administra­\ntion” of sodium thiopental “eliminates any meaningful risk\nthat a prisoner would experience pain from the subse­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Based on that premise, the Court ultimately\nrejected the challenge to Kentucky’s protocol, with the\nplurality opinion concluding that the State’s procedures\nfor administering these three drugs ensured there was no\n“objectively intolerable risk” of severe pain. Id., at 61–62\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n                              B\n  For many years, Oklahoma performed executions using\nthe same three drugs at issue in Baze. After Baze was\ndecided, however, the primary producer of sodium thio­\npental refused to continue permitting the drug to be used\nin executions. Ante, at 4–5. Like a number of other\nStates, Oklahoma opted to substitute pentobarbital, an­\nother barbiturate, in its place. But in March 2014, shortly\nbefore two scheduled executions, Oklahoma found itself\nunable to secure this drug. App. 144.\n  The State rescheduled the executions for the following\nmonth to give it time to locate an alternative anesthetic.\nIn less than a week, a group of officials from the Okla-\nhoma Department of Corrections and the Attorney General’s\noffice selected midazolam to serve as a replacement for\npentobarbital. Id., at 145, 148–149.\n  Soon thereafter, Oklahoma used midazolam for the first\ntime in its execution of Clayton Lockett. That execution\ndid not go smoothly. Ten minutes after an intravenous\n(IV) line was set in Lockett’s groin area and 100 milli­\ngrams of midazolam were administered, an attending\nphysician declared Lockett unconscious. Id., at 392–393.\nWhen the paralytic and potassium chloride were adminis­\ntered, however, Lockett awoke. Ibid. Various witnesses\nreported that Lockett began to writhe against his re­\nstraints, saying, “[t]his s*** is f***ing with my mind,”\n“something is wrong,” and “[t]he drugs aren’t working.”\nId., at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted).

But 10 minutes later—\napproximately 40 minutes after the execution began—\nLockett was pronounced dead. Id., at 395.\n   The State stayed all future executions while it sought to\ndetermine what had gone wrong in Lockett’s. Five months\nlater, the State released an investigative report identify­\ning a flaw in the IV line as the principal difficulty: The IV\nhad failed to fully deliver the lethal drugs into Lockett’s\nveins. Id., at 398. An autopsy determined, however, that\nthe concentration of midazolam in Lockett’s blood was\nmore than sufficient to render an average person uncon­\nscious. Id., at 397, 405.\n   In response to this report, the State modified its lethal\ninjection protocol. The new protocol contains a number of\nprocedures designed to guarantee that members of the\nexecution team are able to insert the IV properly, and\ncharges them with ensuring that the inmate is uncon­\nscious. Id., at 57–66, 361–369. But the protocol continues\nto authorize the use of the same three-drug formula used\nto kill Lockett—though it does increase the intended dose\nof midazolam from 100 milligrams to 500 milligrams. Id.,\nat 61. The State has indicated that it plans to use this\ndrug combination in all upcoming executions, subject to\nonly an immaterial substitution of paralytic agents. Ante,\nat 7–8.\n                            C\n  In June 2014, inmates on Oklahoma’s death row filed a\n42 U. S. C. §1983 suit against respondent prison officials\nchallenging the constitutionality of Oklahoma’s method of\nexecution. After the State released its revised execution\nprotocol, the four inmates whose executions were most\nimminent—Charles Warner, along with petitioners Rich­\nard Glossip, John Grant, and Benjamin Cole—moved for a\npreliminary injunction. They contended, among other\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

The State, in\nturn, based its case on the testimony of Dr. Roswell Evans,\nalso a doctor of pharmacy.\n   To a great extent, the experts’ testimony overlapped.\nAll three experts agreed that midazolam is from a class of\nsedative drugs known as benzodiazepines (a class that\nincludes Valium and Xanax), and that it has no analge­\nsic—or pain-relieving—effects. App. 205 (Lubarsky), 260–\n261 (Sasich), 311 (Evans). They further agreed that while\nmidazolam can be used to render someone unconscious, it\nis not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\nfor use as, and is not in fact used as, a “sole drug to pro­\nduce and maintain anesthesia in surgical proceedings.”\nId., at 307, 327 (Evans); see id., at 171 (Lubarsky); id., at\n262 (Sasich). Finally, all three experts recognized that\nmidazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that\nthere is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug\ndoes not result in any greater effect.          Id., at 172\n(Lubarsky), 243 (Sasich), 331 (Evans).\n   The experts’ opinions diverged, however, on the crucial\nquestions of how this ceiling effect operates, and whether\nit will prevent midazolam from keeping a condemned\ninmate unconscious when the second and third lethal\ninjection drugs are administered. Dr. Lubarsky testified\nthat while benzodiazepines such as midazolam may, like\nbarbiturate drugs such as sodium thiopental and pento­\nbarbital, induce unconsciousness by inhibiting neuron\n\f6                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfunction, they do so in a materially different way. Id., at\n207. More specifically, Dr. Lubarsky explained that both\nbarbiturates and benzodiazepines initially cause sedation\nby facilitating the binding of a naturally occurring chemi­\ncal called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with GABA\nreceptors, which then impedes the flow of electrical im­\npulses through the neurons in the central nervous system.\nId., at 206. But at higher doses, barbiturates also act as a\nGABA substitute and mimic its neuron-suppressing ef­\nfects. Ibid. By contrast, benzodiazepines lack this mim­\nicking function, which means their effect is capped at a\nlower level of sedation. Ibid. Critically, according to Dr.\nLubarsky, this ceiling on midazolam’s sedative effect is\nreached before full anesthesia can be achieved. Ibid.\nThus, in his view, while “midazolam unconsciousness is\n. . . sufficient” for “minor procedure[s],” Tr. of Preliminary\nInjunction Hearing 132–133 (Tr.), it is incapable of keep­\ning someone “insensate and immobile in the face of [more]\nnoxious stimuli,” including the extreme pain and discom­\nfort associated with administration of the second and third\ndrugs in Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol, App. 218.\nDr. Sasich endorsed Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the\nceiling effect, and offered similar reasons for reaching the\nsame conclusion. See id., at 243, 248, 262.\n    In support of these assertions, both experts cited a\nvariety of evidence. Dr. Lubarsky emphasized, in particu­\nlar, Arizona’s 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, which had\nbeen conducted using midazolam and the drug hydromor­\nphone rather than the three-drug cocktail Oklahoma\nintends to employ.1 Id., at 176. Despite being adminis­\ntered 750 milligrams of midazolam, Wood had continued\nbreathing and moving for nearly two hours—which, ac­\n——————\n  1 Hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic similar to morphine or hero­\n\nin.

Both\nexperts also cited various scientific articles and textbooks\nto support their conclusions. For instance, Dr. Lubarsky\nrelied on a study measuring the brain activity of rats that\nwere administered midazolam, which showed that the\ndrug’s impact significantly tailed off at higher doses. See\nHovinga et al., Pharmacokinetic-EEG Effect Relationship\nof Midazolam in Aging BN/BiRij Rats, 107 British J.\nPharmacology 171, 173, Fig. 2 (1992). He also pointed to a\npharmacology textbook that confirmed his description of\nhow benzodiazepines and barbiturates produce their\neffects, see Stoelting & Hillier 127–128, 140–144, and a\nsurvey article concluding that “[m]idazolam cannot be\nused alone . . . to maintain adequate anesthesia,” Reves,\nFragen, Vinik, & Greenblatt, Midazolam: Pharmacology\nand Uses, 62 Anesthesiology 310, 318 (1985) (Reves). For\nhis part, Dr. Sasich referred to a separate survey article,\nwhich similarly recognized and described the ceiling effect\nto which benzodiazepines are subject. See Saari, Uusi-\nOukari, Ahonen, & Olkkola, Enhancement of GABAergic\nActivity: Neuropharmacological Effects of Benzodiazepines\nand Therapeutic Use in Anesthesiology, 63 Pharamacolog­\nical Rev. 243, 244, 250 (2011) (Saari).\n  By contrast, Dr. Evans, the State’s expert, asserted that\na 500-milligram dose of midazolam would “render the\nperson unconscious and ‘insensate’ during the remainder\nof the [execution] procedure.” App. 294. He rested this\nconclusion on two interrelated propositions.\n  First, observing that a therapeutic dose of midazolam to\ntreat anxiety is less than 5 milligrams for a 70-kilogram\nadult, Dr. Evans emphasized that Oklahoma’s planned\nadministration of 500 milligrams of the drug was “at least\n100 times the normal therapeutic dose.” Ibid. While he\nacknowledged that “[t]here are no studies that have been\ndone . . . administering that much . . . midazolam . . . to\n\f8                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nanybody,” he noted that deaths had occurred in doses as\nlow as 0.04 to 0.07 milligrams per kilogram (2.8 to 4.9\nmilligrams for a 70-kilogram adult), and contended that a\n500-milligram dose would itself cause death within less\nthan an hour—a conclusion he characterized as “essentially\nan extrapolation from a toxic effect.” Id., at 327; see id.,\nat 308.\n   Second, in explaining how he reconciled his opinion with\nthe evidence of midazolam’s ceiling effect, Dr. Evans testi­\nfied that while “GABA receptors are found across the\nentire body,” midazolam’s ceiling effect is limited to the\n“spinal cord” and there is “no ceiling effect” at the “higher\nlevel of [the] brain.” Id., at 311–312. Consequently, in his\nview, “as you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a linear\neffect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact from\nhigher doses of the drug,” id., at 332, until eventually\n“you’re paralyzing the brain,” id., at 314. Dr. Evans also\nunderstood the chemical source of midazolam’s ceiling\neffect somewhat differently from petitioners’ experts.\nAlthough he agreed that midazolam produces its effect by\n“binding to [GABA] receptors,” id., at 293, he appeared to\nbelieve that midazolam produced sedation by “inhibiting\nGABA” from attaching to GABA receptors, not by promot­\ning GABA’s sedative effects, id., at 312. Thus, when asked\nabout Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the ceiling effect, Dr.\nEvans characterized the phenomenon as stemming from\n“the competitive nature of substances trying to attach to\nGABA receptors.” Id., at 313.\n   Dr. Evans cited no scholarly research in support of his\nopinions. Instead, he appeared to rely primarily on two\nsources: the Web site www.drugs.com, and a “Material\nSafety Data Sheet” produced by a midazolam manufacturer.\nSee id., at 303. Both simply contained general infor­\nmation that covered the experts’ areas of agreement.\n\f                   Cite as: 576 U.

It began by making a series of\nfactual findings regarding the characteristics of midazo­\nlam and its use in Oklahoma’s execution protocol. Most\nrelevant here, the District Court found that “[t]he proper\nadministration of 500 milligrams of midazolam . . . would\nmake it a virtual certainty that an individual will be at a\nsufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious\nstimuli which could occur from the application of the\nsecond and third drugs.” Id., at 77. Respecting petition­\ners’ contention that there is a “ceiling effect which pre­\nvents an increase in dosage from having a corresponding\nincremental effect on anesthetic depth,” the District Court\nconcluded:\n    “Dr. Evans testified persuasively . . . that whatever\n    the ceiling effect of midazolam may be with respect to\n    anesthesia, which takes effect at the spinal cord level,\n    there is no ceiling effect with respect to the ability of a\n    500 milligram dose of midazolam to effectively para­\n    lyze the brain, a phenomenon which is not anesthesia\n    but does have the effect of shutting down respiration\n    and eliminating the individual’s awareness of pain.”\n    Id., at 78.\n   Having made these findings, the District Court held\nthat petitioners had shown no likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their Eighth Amendment claim for two inde­\npendent reasons. First, it determined that petitioners had\n“failed to establish that proceeding with [their] execu­\ntion[s] . . . on the basis of the revised protocol presents . . .\n‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” Id., at 96. Sec­\nond, the District Court held that petitioners were unlikely\nto prevail because they had not identified any “ ‘known and\navailable alternative’ ” means by which they could be\nexecuted—a requirement it understood Baze to impose.\n\f10                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nId., at 97. The District Court concluded that the State\n“ha[d] affirmatively shown that sodium thiopental and\npentobarbital, the only alternatives to which the [petition­\ners] have even alluded, are not available to the [State].”\nId., at 98.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nWarner v. Gross, 776 F. 3d 721 (2015). It, like the District\nCourt, held that petitioners were unlikely to prevail on the\nmerits because they had failed to prove the existence of\n“ ‘known and available alternatives.’ ” Id., at 732. “In any\nevent,” the court continued, it was unable to conclude that\nthe District Court’s factual findings had been clearly\nerroneous, and thus petitioners had also “failed to estab­\nlish that the use of midazolam in their executions . . .\ncreates a demonstrated risk of severe pain.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners and Charles Warner filed a petition for\ncertiorari and an application to stay their executions. The\nCourt denied the stay application, and Charles Warner\nwas executed on January 15, 2015. See Warner v. Gross,\n574 U. S. ___ (2015) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari). The Court subsequently granted\ncertiorari and, at the request of the State, stayed petition­\ners’ pending executions.\n                             II\n  I begin with the second of the Court’s two holdings: that\nthe District Court properly found that petitioners did not\ndemonstrate a likelihood of showing that Oklahoma’s\nexecution protocol poses an unconstitutional risk of pain.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court sweeps aside sub­\nstantial evidence showing that, while midazolam may be\nable to induce unconsciousness, it cannot be utilized to\nmaintain unconsciousness in the face of agonizing stimuli.\nInstead, like the District Court, the Court finds comfort in\nDr. Evans’ wholly unsupported claims that 500 milligrams\nof midazolam will “paralyz[e] the brain.” In so holding,\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court disregards an objectively intolerable risk of\nsevere pain.\n                              A\n   Like the Court, I would review for clear error the Dis­\ntrict Court’s finding that 500 milligrams of midazolam will\nrender someone sufficiently unconscious “ ‘to resist the\nnoxious stimuli which could occur from the application of\nthe second and third drugs.’ ” Ante, at 18–19 (quoting App.\n77). Unlike the Court, however, I would do so without\nabdicating our duty to examine critically the factual predi­\ncates for the District Court’s finding—namely, Dr. Evans’\ntestimony that midazolam has a “ceiling effect” only “at\nthe spinal cord level,” and that a “500 milligram dose of\nmidazolam” can therefore “effectively paralyze the brain.”\nId., at 78. To be sure, as the Court observes, such scien­\ntific testimony may at times lie at the boundaries of fed­\neral courts’ expertise. See ante, at 17–18. But just because\na purported expert says something does not make it so.\nEspecially when important constitutional rights are at\nstake, federal district courts must carefully evaluate the\npremises and evidence on which scientific conclusions are\nbased, and appellate courts must ensure that the courts\nbelow have in fact carefully considered all the evidence\npresented. Clear error exists “when although there is\nevidence to support” a finding, “the reviewing court on the\nentire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction\nthat a mistake has been committed.” United States v.\nUnited States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948).\nHere, given the numerous flaws in Dr. Evans’ testimony,\nthere can be little doubt that the District Court clearly\nerred in relying on it.\n   To begin, Dr. Evans identified no scientific literature to\nsupport his opinion regarding midazolam’s properties at\nhigher-than-normal doses. Apart from a Material Safety\nData Sheet that was relevant only insofar as it suggests\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat a low dose of midazolam may occasionally be toxic,\nsee ante, at 27—an issue I discuss further below—Dr.\nEvans’ testimony seems to have been based on the Web\nsite www.drugs.com. The Court may be right that “peti­\ntioners do not identify any incorrect statements from\ndrugs.com on which Dr. Evans relied.” Ante, at 27. But\nthat is because there were no statements from drugs.com\nthat supported the critically disputed aspects of Dr. Evans’\nopinion. If anything, the Web site supported petitioners’\ncontentions, as it expressly cautioned that midazolam\n“[s]hould not be used alone for maintenance of anesthe­\nsia,” App. H to Pet. for Cert. 6159, and contained no warn­\ning that an excessive dose of midazolam could “paralyze\nthe brain,” see id., at 6528–6529.\n   Most importantly, nothing from drugs.com—or, for that\nmatter, any other source in the record—corroborated Dr.\nEvans’ key testimony that midazolam’s ceiling effect is\nlimited to the spinal cord and does not pertain to the\nbrain. Indeed, the State appears to have disavowed Dr.\nEvans’ spinal-cord theory, refraining from even mention­\ning it in its brief despite the fact that the District Court\nexpressly relied on this testimony as the basis for finding\nthat larger doses of midazolam will have greater anesthetic\neffects. App. 78. The Court likewise assiduously avoids\ndefending this theory.\n   That is likely because this aspect of Dr. Evans’ testi-\nmony was not just unsupported, but was directly refuted by\nthe studies and articles cited by Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich.\nBoth of these experts relied on academic texts describing\nbenzodiazepines’ ceiling effect and explaining why it pre­\nvents these drugs from rendering a person completely\ninsensate. See Stoelting & Hillier 141, 144 (describing\nmidazolam’s ceiling effect and contrasting the drug with\nbarbiturates); Saari 244 (observing that “abolishment of\nperception of environmental stimuli cannot usually be\ngenerated”). One study further made clear that the ceiling\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U.

See id., at 250.\n  These scientific sources also appear to demonstrate that\nDr. Evans’ spinal-cord theory—i.e., that midazolam’s\nceiling effect is limited to the spinal cord—was premised\non a basic misunderstanding of midazolam’s mechanism of\naction. I say “appear” not because the sources themselves\nare unclear about how midazolam operates: They plainly\nstate that midazolam functions by promoting GABA’s\ninhibitory effects on the central nervous system. See, e.g.,\nStoelting & Hillier 140. Instead, I use “appear” because\ndiscerning the rationale underlying Dr. Evans’ testimony\nis difficult. His spinal-cord theory might, however, be\nexplained at least in part by his apparent belief that rather\nthan promoting GABA’s inhibitory effects, midazolam\nproduces sedation by “compet[ing]” with GABA and thus\n“inhibit[ing]” GABA’s effect. App. 312–313.2 Regardless, I\nneed not delve too deeply into Dr. Evans’ alternative\nscientific reality. It suffices to say that to the extent that\nDr. Evans’ testimony was based on his understanding of\nthe source of midazolam’s pharmacological properties, that\nunderstanding was wrong.\n——————\n  2 The Court disputes this characterization of Dr. Evans’ testimony,\n\ninsisting that Dr. Evans accurately described midazolam’s properties in\nthe written report he submitted prior to the hearing below, and sug­\ngesting that petitioners’ experts would have “dispute[d] the accuracy” of\nthis explanation were it in fact wrong. Ante, at 25. But Dr. Evans’\nwritten report simply said midazolam “produces different levels of\ncentral nervous system (CNS) depression through binding to [GABA]\nreceptors.” App. 293. That much is true. Only after Drs. Sasich and\nLubarsky testified did Dr. Evans further claim that midazolam pro­\nduced CNS depression by binding to GABA receptors and thereby\npreventing GABA itself from binding to those receptors—which is where\nhe went wrong. The Court’s further observation that Dr. Lubarsky also\nused a variant on the word “inhibiting” in his testimony—in saying that\nGABA’s “ ‘inhibition of brain activity is accentuated by midazolam,’ ”\nante, at 25 (quoting App. 232)—is completely nonresponsive. “Inhibit­\ning” is a perfectly good word; the problem here is the manner in which\nDr. Evans used it in a sentence.\n\f14                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   These inconsistencies and inaccuracies go to the very\nheart of Dr. Evans’ expert opinion, as they were the key\ncomponents of his professed belief that one can extrapolate\nfrom what is known about midazolam’s effect at low doses\nto conclude that the drug would “paralyz[e] the brain” at\nOklahoma’s planned dose. Id., at 314. All three experts\nrecognized that there had been no scientific testing on the\nuse of this amount of midazolam in conjunction with these\nparticular lethal injection drugs. See ante, at 19; App. 176\n(Lubarsky), 243–244 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). For this rea­\nson, as the Court correctly observes, “extrapolation was\nreasonable.” Ante, at 20. But simply because extrapola­\ntion may be reasonable or even required does not mean\nthat every conceivable method of extrapolation can be\ncredited, or that all estimates stemming from purported\nextrapolation are worthy of belief. Dr. Evans’ view was\nthat because 40 milligrams of midazolam could be used to\ninduce unconsciousness, App. 294, and because more drug\nwill generally produce more effect, a significantly larger\ndose of 500 milligrams would not just induce unconscious­\nness but allow for its maintenance in the face of extremely\npainful stimuli, and ultimately even cause death itself. In\nhis words: “[A]s you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a\nlinear effect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact\nfrom higher doses of the drug.” Id., at 332. If, however,\nthere is a ceiling with respect to midazolam’s effect on the\nbrain—as petitioners’ experts established there is—then\nsuch simplistic logic is not viable. In this context, more is\nnot necessarily better, and Dr. Evans was plainly wrong to\npresume it would be.\n   If Dr. Evans had any other basis for the “extrapolation”\nthat led him to conclude 500 milligrams of midazolam\nwould “paralyz[e] the brain,” id., at 314, it was even fur­\nther divorced from scientific evidence and logic. Having\nemphasized that midazolam had been known to cause\napproximately 80 deaths, Dr. Evans asserted that his\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U.

Thus, Dr. Evans appeared to believe—and again, I\nsay “appeared” because his rationale is not clear—that\nbecause midazolam caused some deaths, it would neces­\nsarily cause complete unconsciousness and then death at\nespecially high doses. But Dr. Evans also thought, and\nDr. Lubarsky confirmed, that these midazolam fatalities\nhad occurred at very low doses—well below what any\nexpert said would produce unconsciousness. See id., at\n207, 308. These deaths thus seem to represent the rare,\nunfortunate side effects that one would expect to see with\nany drug at normal therapeutic doses; they provide no\nindication of the effect one would expect midazolam to\nhave on the brain at substantially higher doses. Deaths\noccur with almost any product. One might as well say\nthat because some people occasionally die from eating one\npeanut, one hundred peanuts would necessarily induce a\ncoma and death in anyone.3\n  In sum, then, Dr. Evans’ conclusions were entirely\nunsupported by any study or third-party source, contra­\ndicted by the extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners,\ninconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazo­\nlam’s properties, and apparently premised on basic logical\nerrors. Given these glaring flaws, the District Court’s\n——————\n  3 For all the reasons discussed in Part II–B, infra, and contrary to the\nCourt’s claim, see ante, at 20, n. 4, there are good reasons to doubt that\n500 milligrams of midazolam will, in light of the ceiling effect, inevita­\nbly kill someone. The closest the record comes to providing support for\nthis contention is the fleeting mention in the FDA-approved product\nlabel that one of the possible consequences of midazolam overdosage is\ncoma. See ante, at 21, n. 5. Moreover, even if this amount of the drug\ncould kill some people in “under an hour,” ante, at 20, n. 4, that would\nnot necessarily mean that the condemned would be insensate during\nthe approximately 10 minutes it takes for the paralytic and potassium\nchloride to do their work.\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nacceptance of Dr. Evans’ claim that 500 milligrams of\nmidazolam would “paralyz[e] the brain” cannot be credited.\nThis is not a case “[w]here there are two permissible\nviews of the evidence,” and the District Court chose one;\nrather, it is one where the trial judge credited “one of two\nor more witnesses” even though that witness failed to tell\n“a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contra­\ndicted by extrinsic evidence.” Anderson v. Bessemer City,\n470 U. S. 564, 574–575 (1985). In other words, this is a\ncase in which the District Court clearly erred. See ibid.\n                               B\n   Setting aside the District Court’s erroneous factual\nfinding that 500 milligrams of midazolam will necessarily\n“paralyze the brain,” the question is whether the Court is\nnevertheless correct to hold that petitioners failed to\ndemonstrate that the use of midazolam poses an “objec­\ntively intolerable risk” of severe pain. See Baze, 553 U. S.,\nat 50 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). I would hold that they made this showing. That is\nbecause, in stark contrast to Dr. Evans, petitioners’ ex­\nperts were able to point to objective evidence indicating\nthat midazolam cannot serve as an effective anesthetic\nthat “render[s] a person insensate to pain caused by the\nsecond and third [lethal injection] drugs.” Ante, at 23.\n   As observed above, these experts cited multiple sources\nsupporting the existence of midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nThat evidence alone provides ample reason to doubt mid­\nazolam’s efficacy. Again, to prevail on their claim, peti­\ntioners need only establish an intolerable risk of pain, not\na certainty. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 50. Here, the State is\nattempting to use midazolam to produce an effect the drug\nhas never previously been demonstrated to produce, and\ndespite studies indicating that at some point increasing\nthe dose will not actually increase the drug’s effect. The\nState is thus proceeding in the face of a very real risk that\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U.

The\nCourt insists that petitioners failed to provide “probative\nevidence” as to whether “midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs\nbelow the level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at\nwhich the drug does not have the effect of rendering a\nperson insensate to pain.” Ante, at 23. It emphasizes that\nDr. Lubarsky was unable to say “at what dose the ceiling\neffect occurs,” and could only estimate that it was\n“ ‘[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams.’ ” Ante, at\n23 (quoting App. 225).\n    But the precise dose at which midazolam reaches its\nceiling effect is irrelevant if there is no dose at which the\ndrug can, in the Court’s words, render a person “insensate\nto pain.” Ante, at 23. On this critical point, Dr. Lubarsky\nwas quite clear.4 He explained that the drug “does not\nwork to produce” a “lack of consciousness as noxious stim­\nuli are applied,” and is “not sufficient to produce a surgical\nplane of anesthesia in human beings.” App. 204. He also\n——————\n  4 Dr. Sasich, as the Court emphasizes, was perhaps more hesitant to\nreach definitive conclusions, see ante, at 19–21, and n. 5, 23–24, but the\nstatements highlighted by the Court largely reflect his (truthful)\nobservations that no testing has been done at doses of 500 milligrams,\nand his inability to pinpoint the precise dose at which midazolam's\nceiling effect might be reached. Dr. Sasich did not, as the Court sug­\ngests, claim that midazolam’s ceiling effect would be reached only after\na person became fully insensate to pain. Ante, at 24. What Dr. Sasich\nactually said was: “As the dose increases, the benzodiazepines are\nexpected to produce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to\nstimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).” App. 243. In context, it is\nclear that Dr. Sasich was simply explaining that a drug like midazolam\ncan be used to induce unconsciousness—an issue that was and remains\nundisputed—not that it could render an inmate sufficiently unconscious\nto resist all noxious stimuli. Indeed, it was midazolam’s possible\ninability to serve the latter function that led Dr. Sasich to conclude that\n“it is not an appropriate drug to use when administering a paralytic\nfollowed by potassium chloride.” Id., at 248.\n\f18                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnoted that “[t]he drug would never be used and has never\nbeen used as a sole anesthetic to give anesthesia during a\nsurgery,” id., at 223, and asserted that “the drug was not\napproved by the FDA as a sole anesthetic because after\nthe use of fairly large doses that were sufficient to reach\nthe ceiling effect and produce induction of unconscious­\nness, the patients responded to the surgery,” id., at 219.\nThus, Dr. Lubarsky may not have been able to identify\nwhether this effect would be reached at 40, 50, or 60 milli­\ngrams or some higher threshold, but he could specify\nthat at no level would midazolam reliably keep an in-\nmate unconscious once the second and third drugs were\ndelivered.5\n   These assertions were amply supported by the evidence\nof the manner in which midazolam is and can be used. All\nthree experts agreed that midazolam is utilized as the sole\nsedative only in minor procedures. Dr. Evans, for exam­\nple, acknowledged that while midazolam may be used as\nthe sole drug in some procedures that are not “terribly\ninvasive,” even then “you would [generally] see it used in\ncombination with a narcotic.” Id., at 307. And though, as\nthe Court observes, Dr. Sasich believed midazolam could\nbe “used for medical procedures like colonoscopies and\ngastroscopies,” ante, at 21, he insisted that these proce­\ndures were not necessarily painful, and that it would be a\n——————\n  5 The Court claims that the District Court could have properly disre­\n\ngarded Dr. Lubarsky’s testimony because he asserted that a protocol\nwith sodium thiopental would “ ‘produce egregious harm and suffer­\ning.’ ” Ante, at 24, n. 6 (quoting App. 227). But Dr. Lubarsky did not\ntestify that, like midazolam, sodium thiopental would not render an\ninmate fully insensate even if properly administered; rather, he simply\nobserved that he had previously contended that protocols using that\ndrug were ineffective. See App. 227. He was presumably referring to\nan article he coauthored that found many condemned inmates were not\nbeing successfully delivered the dose of sodium thiopental necessary to\nfully anesthetize them.

Tr.\n369–370. Indeed, the record provides no reason to think\nthat these procedures cause excruciating pain remotely\ncomparable to that produced by the second and third\nlethal injection drugs Oklahoma intends to use.\n   As for more painful procedures, the consensus was also\nclear: Midazolam is not FDA-approved for, and is not used\nas, a sole drug to maintain unconsciousness. See App. 171\n(Lubarsky), 262 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). One might infer\nfrom the fact that midazolam is not used as the sole anes­\nthetic for more serious procedures that it cannot be used\nfor them. But drawing such an inference is unnecessary,\nas petitioners’ experts invoked sources expressly stating\nas much. In particular, Dr. Lubarsky pointed to a survey\narticle that cited four separate authorities and declared\nthat “[m]idazolam cannot be used alone . . . to maintain\nadequate anesthesia.” Reves 318; see also Stoelting &\nHillier 145 (explaining that midzolam is used for “induc­\ntion of anesthesia,” and that, “[i]n combination with other\ndrugs, [it] may be used for maintenance of anesthesia”\n(emphasis added)).\n   This evidence was alone sufficient, but if one wanted\nfurther support for these conclusions it was provided by\nthe Lockett and Wood executions. The procedural flaws\nthat marred the Lockett execution created the conditions\nfor an unintended (and grotesque) experiment on midazo­\nlam’s efficacy. Due to problems with the IV line, Lockett\nwas not fully paralyzed after the second and third drugs\nwere administered. He had, however, been administered\nmore than enough midazolam to “render an average per­\nson unconscious,” as the District Court found. App. 57.\nWhen Lockett awoke and began to writhe and speak, he\ndemonstrated the critical difference between midazolam’s\nability to render an inmate unconscious and its ability to\nmaintain the inmate in that state. The Court insists that\n\f20                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nLockett’s execution involved “only 100 milligrams of mid­\nazolam,” ante, at 28, but as explained previously, more is\nnot necessarily better given midazolam’s ceiling effect.\n  The Wood execution is perhaps even more probative.\nDespite being given over 750 milligrams of midazolam,\nWood gasped and snorted for nearly two hours. These\nreactions were, according to Dr. Lubarsky, inconsistent\nwith Wood being fully anesthetized, App. 177–178, and\nbelie the claim that a lesser dose of 500 milligrams would\nsomehow suffice. The Court attempts to distinguish the\nWood execution on the ground that the timing of Arizona’s\nadministration of midazolam was different. Ante, at 28.\nBut as Dr. Lubarsky testified, it did not “matter” whether\nin Wood’s execution the “midazolam was introduced all at\nonce or over . . . multiple doses,” because “[t]he drug has a\nsufficient half life that the effect is cumulative.” App. 220;\nsee also Saari 253 (midazolam’s “elimination half-life\nranges from 1.7 to 3.5 h[ours]”).6 Nor does the fact that\nWood’s dose of midazolam was paired with hydromor­\nphone rather than a paralytic and potassium chromide,\nsee ante, at 29, appear to have any relevance—other than\nthat the use of this analgesic drug may have meant that\nWood did not experience the same degree of searing pain\nthat an inmate executed under Oklahoma’s protocol may\nface.\n  By contrast, Florida’s use of this same three-drug proto­\ncol in 11 executions, see ante, at 28 (citing Brief for State\nof Florida as Amicus Curiae 1), tells us virtually nothing.\nAlthough these executions have featured no obvious mis­\nhaps, the key word is “obvious.” Because the protocol\n——————\n  6 The Court asserts that the State refuted these contentions, pointing\n\nto Dr. Evans’ testimony that 750 milligrams of the drug “might not\nhave the effect that was sought” if administered over an hour.

Sasich and Lubarsky explained, impossible to tell\nwhether the condemned inmate in fact remained uncon­\nscious. App. 218, 273; see also Baze, 553 U. S., at 71\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Even in these\nexecutions, moreover, there have been indications of the\ninmates’ possible awareness. See Brief for State of Ala­\nbama et al. as Amici Curiae 9–13 (describing the 11 Flor-\nida executions, and noting that some allegedly involved\nblinking and other movement after administration of the\nthree drugs).7\n   Finally, none of the State’s “safeguards” for administer­\ning these drugs would seem to mitigate the substantial\nrisk that midazolam will not work, as the Court contends.\nSee ante, at 21–22. Protections ensuring that officials\nhave properly secured a viable IV site will not enable\nmidazolam to have an effect that it is chemically incapable\nof having. Nor is there any indication that the State’s\nmonitoring of the inmate’s consciousness will be able to\nanticipate whether the inmate will remain unconscious\nwhile the second and third drugs are administered. No\none questions whether midazolam can induce uncon­\nsciousness. The problem, as Lockett’s execution vividly\nillustrates, is that an unconscious inmate may be awak­\nened by the pain and respiratory distress caused by ad­\nministration of the second and third drugs. At that point,\neven if it were possible to determine whether the inmate is\nconscious—dubious, given the use of a paralytic—it is\nalready too late. Presumably for these reasons, the Tenth\nCircuit characterized the District Court’s reliance on these\nprocedural mechanisms as “not relevant to its rejection of\n——————\n  7 The fact that courts in Florida have approved the use of midazolam\n\nin this fashion is arguably slightly more relevant, though it is worth\nnoting that the majority of these decisions were handed down before\nthe Lockett and Wood executions, and that some relied, as here, on Dr.\nEvans’ testimony.

Petition­\ners have not been accorded a full hearing on the merits of\ntheir claim. They were granted only an abbreviated evi­\ndentiary proceeding that began less than three months\nafter the State issued its amended execution protocol; they\ndid not even have the opportunity to present rebuttal\nevidence after Dr. Evans testified. They sought a prelimi­\nnary injunction, and thus were not required to prove their\nclaim, but only to show that they were likely to succeed on\nthe merits. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20 (2008); Hill v. McDonough,\n547 U. S. 573, 584 (2006).\n  Perhaps the State could prevail after a full hearing,\nthough this would require more than Dr. Evans’ unsup­\nported testimony. At the preliminary injunction stage,\nhowever, petitioners presented compelling evidence sug­\ngesting that midazolam will not work as the State intends.\nThe State, by contrast, offered absolutely no contrary\nevidence worth crediting. Petitioners are thus at the very\nleast likely to prove that, due to midazolam’s inherent\ndeficiencies, there is a constitutionally intolerable risk\nthat they will be awake, yet unable to move, while chemi­\ncals known to cause “excruciating pain” course through\ntheir veins.

The Court first\nconfronted an Eighth Amendment challenge to a method\nof execution in Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130 (1879).\nAlthough Wilkerson approved the particular method at\nissue—the firing squad—it made clear that “public dissec­\ntion,” “burning alive,” and other “punishments of torture\n. . . in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden\nby [the Eighth A]mendment to the Constitution.” Id., at\n135–136. Eleven years later, in rejecting a challenge to\nthe first proposed use of the electric chair, the Court again\nreiterated that “if the punishment prescribed for an of­\nfense against the laws of the State were manifestly cruel\nand unusual, as burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking\non the wheel, or the like, it would be the duty of the courts\nto adjudge such penalties to be within the constitutional\nprohibition.” In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 446 (1890).\n    In the more than a century since, the Members of this\nCourt have often had cause to debate the full scope of the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual\npunishment. See, e.g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238\n(1972). But there has been little dispute that it at the\nvery least precludes the imposition of “barbarous physical\npunishments.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 345\n(1981); see, e.g., Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 284 (1983);\nid., at 312–313 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); Baze, 553 U. S.,\nat 97–99 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); Harmelin\nv. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 976 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). Nor has there been any question that the Amendment\nprohibits such “inherently barbaric punishments under all\ncircumstances.” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48, 59\n\f24                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(2010) (emphasis added). Simply stated, the “Eighth\nAmendment categorically prohibits the infliction of cruel\nand unusual punishments.” Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.\n302, 330 (1989) (emphasis added).\n                               B\n   The Court today, however, would convert this categori­\ncal prohibition into a conditional one. A method of execu­\ntion that is intolerably painful—even to the point of being\nthe chemical equivalent of burning alive—will, the Court\nholds, be unconstitutional if, and only if, there is a “known\nand available alternative” method of execution. Ante, at\n15. It deems Baze to foreclose any argument to the con­\ntrary. Ante, at 14.\n   Baze held no such thing. In the first place, the Court\ncites only the plurality opinion in Baze as support for its\nknown-and-available-alternative requirement. See ibid.\nEven assuming that the Baze plurality set forth such a\nrequirement—which it did not—none of the Members of\nthe Court whose concurrences were necessary to sustain\nthe Baze Court’s judgment articulated a similar view. See\n553 U. S., at 71–77, 87 (Stevens, J., concurring in judg­\nment); id., at 94, 99–107 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­\nment); id., at 107–108, 113 (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment). In general, “the holding of the Court may be\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”\nMarks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And as the Court observes,\nante, at 14, n. 2, the opinion of JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by\nJUSTICE SCALIA, took the broadest position with respect to\nthe degree of intent that state officials must have in\norder to have violated the Eighth Amendment, concluding\nthat only a method of execution deliberately designed\nto inflict pain, and not one simply designed with deliberate\nindifference to the risk of severe pain, would be un­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

But this understanding of the Eighth\nAmendment’s intent requirement is unrelated to, and thus\nnot any broader or narrower than, the requirement the\nCourt now divines from Baze. Because the position that a\nplaintiff challenging a method of execution under the\nEighth Amendment must prove the availability of an\nalternative means of execution did not “represent the\nviews of a majority of the Court,” it was not the holding of\nthe Baze Court. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America,\n481 U. S. 69, 81 (1987).\n   In any event, even the Baze plurality opinion provides\nno support for the Court’s proposition. To be sure, that\nopinion contains the following sentence: “[The condemned]\nmust show that the risk is substantial when compared to\nthe known and available alternatives.” 553 U. S., at 61.\nBut the meaning of that key sentence and the limits of the\nrequirement it imposed are made clear by the sentence\ndirectly preceding it: “A stay of execution may not be\ngranted on grounds such as those asserted here unless the\ncondemned prisoner establishes that the State’s lethal\ninjection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe\npain.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In Baze, the very premise\nof the petitioners’ Eighth Amendment claim was that they\nhad “identified a significant risk of harm [in Kentucky’s\nprotocol] that [could] be eliminated by adopting alterna­\ntive procedures.” Id., at 51. Their basic theory was that\neven if the risk of pain was only, say, 25%, that risk would\nbe objectively intolerable if there was an obvious alterna­\ntive that would reduce the risk to 5%. See Brief for Peti­\ntioners in Baze v. Rees, O. T. 2007, No. 07–5439, p. 29 (“In\nview of the severity of the pain risked and the ease with\nwhich it could be avoided, Petitioners should not have\nbeen required to show a high likelihood that they would\nsuffer such pain . . . ”). Thus, the “grounds . . . asserted”\nfor relief in Baze were that the State’s protocol was intol­\n\f26                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nerably risky given the alternative procedures the State\ncould have employed.\n   Addressing this claim, the Baze plurality clarified that\n“a condemned prisoner cannot successfully challenge a\nState’s method of execution merely by showing a slightly\nor marginally safer alternative,” 553 U. S., at 51; instead,\nto succeed in a challenge of this type, the comparative risk\nmust be “substantial,” id., at 61. Nowhere did the plurality\nsuggest that all challenges to a State’s method of execu­\ntion would require this sort of comparative-risk analysis.\nRecognizing the relevance of available alternatives is not\nat all the same as concluding that their absence precludes\na claimant from showing that a chosen method carries\nobjectively intolerable risks. If, for example, prison offi­\ncials chose a method of execution that has a 99% chance of\ncausing lingering and excruciating pain, certainly that\nrisk would be objectively intolerable whether or not the\nofficials ignored other methods in making this choice.\nIrrespective of the existence of alternatives, there are\nsome risks “so grave that it violates contemporary stand­\nards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to” them.\nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 36 (1993) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   That the Baze plurality’s statement regarding a con­\ndemned inmate’s ability to point to an available alterna­\ntive means of execution pertained only to challenges prem­\nised on the existence of such alternatives is further\nevidenced by the opinion’s failure to distinguish or even\nmention the Court’s unanimous decision in Hill v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 573. Hill held that a §1983 plain­\ntiff challenging a State’s method of execution need not\n“identif[y] an alternative, authorized method of execution.”\nId., at 582.

S., at 582.\nBut that only confirms that the Court in Hill did not view\nthe availability of an alternative means of execution as an\nelement of an Eighth Amendment claim: If it had, then\nrequiring the plaintiff to plead this element would not\nhave meant imposing a heightened standard at all, but\nrather would have been entirely consistent with “tradi­\ntional pleading requirements.” Ibid.; see Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U. S. 662, 678 (2009). The Baze plurality opinion\nshould not be understood to have so carelessly tossed aside\nHill’s underlying premise less than two years later.\n                              C\n   In reengineering Baze to support its newfound rule, the\nCourt appears to rely on a flawed syllogism. If the death\npenalty is constitutional, the Court reasons, then there\nmust be a means of accomplishing it, and thus some avail­\nable method of execution must be constitutional. See ante,\nat 4, 15–16. But even accepting that the death penalty is,\nin the abstract, consistent with evolving standards of\ndecency, but see ante, p. ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting), the\nCourt’s conclusion does not follow. The constitutionality of\nthe death penalty may inform our conception of the degree\nof pain that would render a particular method of imposing\nit unconstitutional. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 47 (plurality\nopinion) (because “[s]ome risk of pain is inherent in any\nmethod of execution,” “[i]t is clear . . . the Constitution\ndoes not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain”). But a\nmethod of execution that is “barbarous,” Rhodes, 452\nU. S., at 345, or “involve[s] torture or a lingering death,”\nKemmler, 136 U. S., at 447, does not become less so just\nbecause it is the only method currently available to a\nState. If all available means of conducting an execution\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment, then conducting\nthe execution will constitute cruel and usual punishment.\nNothing compels a State to perform an execution. It does\n\f28                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot get a constitutional free pass simply because it desires\nto deliver the ultimate penalty; its ends do not justify any\nand all means. If a State wishes to carry out an execution,\nit must do so subject to the constraints that our Constitu­\ntion imposes on it, including the obligation to ensure that\nits chosen method is not cruel and unusual. Certainly the\ncondemned has no duty to devise or pick a constitutional\ninstrument of his or her own death.\n   For these reasons, the Court’s available-alternative\nrequirement leads to patently absurd consequences.\nPetitioners contend that Oklahoma’s current protocol is a\nbarbarous method of punishment—the chemical equiva­\nlent of being burned alive. But under the Court’s new\nrule, it would not matter whether the State intended to\nuse midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and\nquartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at\nthe stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availabil­\nity of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could\nexecute them using whatever means it designated. But\nsee Baze, 553 U. S., at 101–102 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (“It strains credulity to suggest that the defin­\ning characteristic of burning at the stake, disemboweling,\ndrawing and quartering, beheading, and the like was that\nthey involved risks of pain that could be eliminated by\nusing alternative methods of execution”).8 The Eighth\nAmendment cannot possibly countenance such a result.\n                            D\n In concocting this additional requirement, the Court is\nmotivated by a desire to preserve States’ ability to conduct\n——————\n   8 The Court protests that its holding does not extend so far, deriding\n\nthis description of the logical implications of its legal rule as “simply\nnot true” and “outlandish rhetoric.” Ante, at 29. But presumably when\nthe Court imposes a “requirement o[n] all Eighth Amendment method-\nof-execution claims,” that requirement in fact applies to “all” methods\nof execution, without exception.

See\nante, at 4–6, 27–28. It is true, as the Court details, that\nStates have faced “practical obstacle[s]” to obtaining lethal\ninjection drugs since Baze was decided. Ante, at 4. One\nstudy concluded that recent years have seen States change\ntheir protocols “with a frequency that is unprecedented\namong execution methods in this country’s history.” Denno,\nLethal Injection Chaos Post-Baze, 102 Geo. L. J. 1331,\n1335 (2014).\n   But why such developments compel the Court’s imposi­\ntion of further burdens on those facing execution is a\nmystery. Petitioners here had no part in creating the\nshortage of execution drugs; it is odd to punish them for\nthe actions of pharmaceutical companies and others who\nseek to disassociate themselves from the death penalty—\nactions which are, of course, wholly lawful. Nor, certainly,\nshould these rapidly changing circumstances give us any\ngreater confidence that the execution methods ultimately\nselected will be sufficiently humane to satisfy the Eighth\nAmendment. Quite the contrary. The execution protocols\nStates hurriedly devise as they scramble to locate new and\nuntested drugs, see supra, at 3, are all the more likely to\nbe cruel and unusual—presumably, these drugs would\nhave been the States’ first choice were they in fact more\neffective. But see Denno, The Lethal Injection Quandry:\nHow Medicine Has Dismantled the Death Penalty, 76\nFord. L. Rev. 49, 65–79 (2007) (describing the hurried and\nunreasoned process by which States first adopted the\noriginal three-drug protocol). Courts’ review of execution\nmethods should be more, not less, searching when States\nare engaged in what is in effect human experimentation.\n   It is also worth noting that some condemned inmates\nmay read the Court’s surreal requirement that they iden­\ntify the means of their death as an invitation to propose\nmethods of executions less consistent with modern sensi­\nbilities. Petitioners here failed to meet the Court’s new\n\f30                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntest because of their assumption that the alternative\ndrugs to which they pointed, pentobarbital and sodium\nthiopental, were available to the State. See ante, at 13–\n14. This was perhaps a reasonable assumption, especially\ngiven that neighboring Texas and Missouri still to this day\ncontinue to use pentobarbital in executions. See The\nDeath Penalty Institute, Execution List 2015, online at\nwww.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2015 (as visited\nJune 26, 2015, and available in the Clerk of the Court’s\ncase file).\n   In the future, however, condemned inmates might well\ndecline to accept States’ current reliance on lethal injec­\ntion. In particular, some inmates may suggest the firing\nsquad as an alternative. Since the 1920’s, only Utah has\nutilized this method of execution. See S. Banner, The\nDeath Penalty 203 (2002); Johnson, Double Murderer\nExecuted by Firing Squad in Utah, N. Y. Times, June 19,\n2010, p. A12. But there is evidence to suggest that the\nfiring squad is significantly more reliable than other\nmethods, including lethal injection using the various\ncombinations of drugs thus far developed. See A. Sarat,\nGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s\nDeath Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that\nwhile 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection\nbetween 1900 and 2010 were “botched,” none of the 34\nexecutions by firing squad had been). Just as important,\nthere is some reason to think that it is relatively quick and\npainless. See Banner, supra, at 203.\n   Certainly, use of the firing squad could be seen as a\ndevolution to a more primitive era. See Wood v. Ryan, 759\nF. 3d 1076, 1103 (CA9 2014) (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). That is not to say, of\ncourse, that it would therefore be unconstitutional. But\nlethal injection represents just the latest iteration of the\nStates’ centuries-long search for “neat and non-disfiguring\nhomicidal methods.” C.

A return to the firing squad—and the\nblood and physical violence that comes with it—is a step in\nthe opposite direction. And some might argue that the\nvisible brutality of such a death could conceivably give rise\nto its own Eighth Amendment concerns. See Campbell v.\nWood, 511 U. S. 1119, 1121–1123 (1994) (Blackmun, J.,\ndissenting from denial of stay of execution and certiorari);\nGlass v. Louisiana, 471 U. S. 1080, 1085 (1985) (Brennan,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari). At least from a\ncondemned inmate’s perspective, however, such visible yet\nrelatively painless violence may be vastly preferable to an\nexcruciatingly painful death hidden behind a veneer of\nmedication. The States may well be reluctant to pull back\nthe curtain for fear of how the rest of us might react to\nwhat we see. But we deserve to know the price of our\ncollective comfort before we blindly allow a State to make\ncondemned inmates pay it in our names.\n                         *    *     *\n   “By protecting even those convicted of heinous crimes,\nthe Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the govern­\nment to respect the dignity of all persons.” Roper v. Sim-\nmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560 (2005). Today, however, the\nCourt absolves the State of Oklahoma of this duty. It does\nso by misconstruing and ignoring the record evidence\nregarding the constitutional insufficiency of midazolam as\na sedative in a three-drug lethal injection cocktail, and by\nimposing a wholly unprecedented obligation on the con­\ndemned inmate to identify an available means for his or\nher own execution. The contortions necessary to save this\nparticular lethal injection protocol are not worth the price.\nI dissent.\n\f", "absolute_url": "/opinion/2812588/glossip-v-gross/", "author": null, "html": "", "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2812588/", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 29, 2015—Decided June 29, 2015\nBecause capital punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitu-\n  tional means of carrying it out. After Oklahoma adopted lethal injec-\n  tion as its method of execution, it settled on a three-drug protocol of\n  (1) sodium thiopental (a barbiturate) to induce a state of uncon-\n  sciousness, (2) a paralytic agent to inhibit all muscular-skeletal\n  movements, and (3) potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest. In\n  Baze v. Rees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145817\"><a href=\"/opinion/145817/baze-v-rees/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court held that this protocol does not\n  violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unu-\n  sual punishments. Anti-death-penalty advocates then pressured\n  pharmaceutical companies to prevent sodium thiopental (and, later,\n  another barbiturate called pentobarbital) from being used in execu-\n  tions. Unable to obtain either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital,\n  Oklahoma decided to use a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, a seda-\n  tive, as the first drug in its three-drug protocol.\n     Oklahoma death-row inmates filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 action\n  claiming that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.\n  Four of those inmates filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and\n  argued that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will not render them\n  unable to feel pain associated with administration of the second and\n  third drugs. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court\n  denied the motion. It held that the prisoners failed to identify a\n  known and available alternative method of execution that presented\n  a substantially less severe risk of pain. It also held that the prison-\n  ers failed to establish a likelihood of showing that the use of midazo-\n  lam created a demonstrated risk of severe pain.

Pp. 11–29.\n       (a) To obtain a preliminary injunction, petitioners must establish,\n    among other things, a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n    claim. See Winter v.

To succeed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-\n    execution claim, a prisoner must establish that the method creates a\n    demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the risk is substantial\n    when compared to the known and available alternatives. Baze, su-\n    pra, at 61 (plurality opinion). Pp. 11–13.\n       (b) Petitioners failed to establish that any risk of harm was sub-\n    stantial when compared to a known and available alternative method\n    of execution. Petitioners have suggested that Oklahoma could exe-\n    cute them using sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, but the District\n    Court did not commit a clear error when it found that those drugs are\n    unavailable to the State. Petitioners argue that the Eighth Amend-\n    ment does not require them to identify such an alternative, but their\n    argument is inconsistent with the controlling opinion in Baze, which\n    imposed a requirement that the Court now follows. Petitioners also\n    argue that the requirement to identify an alternative is inconsistent\n    with the Court’s pre-Baze decision in Hill v. McDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145647\"><a href=\"/opinion/145647/hill-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n    <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but they misread that decision. Hill concerned a question of civ-\n    il procedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment question. That\n    case held that §1983 alone does not require an inmate asserting a\n    method-of-execution claim to plead an acceptable alternative. Baze,\n    on the other hand, made clear that the Eighth Amendment requires a\n    prisoner to plead and prove a known and available alternative.\n    Pp. 13–16.\n       (c) The District Court did not commit clear error when it found that\n    midazolam is likely to render a person unable to feel pain associated\n    with administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.\n    Pp. 16–29.\n          (1) Several initial considerations bear emphasis. First, the Dis-\n    trict Court’s factual findings are reviewed under the deferential\n    “clear error” standard. Second, petitioners have the burden of per-\n    suasion on the question whether midazolam is effective. Third, the\n    fact that numerous courts have concluded that midazolam is likely to\n    render an inmate insensate to pain during execution heightens the\n    deference owed to the District Court’s findings. Finally, challenges to\n    lethal injection protocols test the boundaries of the authority and\n    competency of federal courts, which should not embroil themselves in\n    ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise. Baze, supra,\n    at 51. Pp. 16–18.\n          (2) The State’s expert presented persuasive testimony that a 500-\n    milligram dose of midazolam would make it a virtual certainty that\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  an inmate will not feel pain associated with the second and third\n  drugs, and petitioners’ experts acknowledged that they had no con-\n  trary scientific proof. Expert testimony presented by both sides lends\n  support to the District Court’s conclusion. Evidence suggested that a\n  500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a coma, and even one of\n  petitioners’ experts agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases, it\n  is expected to produce a lack of response to pain. It is not dispositive\n  that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole\n  anesthetic during painful surgery. First, the 500-milligram dose at\n  issue here is many times higher than a normal therapeutic dose.\n  Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for\n  maintaining unconsciousness says little about whether a 500-\n  milligram dose is constitutionally adequate to conduct an execution.\n  Finally, the District Court did not err in concluding that the safe-\n  guards adopted by Oklahoma to ensure proper administration of\n  midazolam serve to minimize any risk that the drug will not operate\n  as intended. Pp. 18–22.\n       (3) Petitioners’ speculative evidence regarding midazolam’s “ceil-\n  ing effect” does not establish that the District Court’s findings were\n  clearly erroneous. The mere fact that midazolam has a ceiling above\n  which an increase in dosage produces no effect cannot be dispositive,\n  and petitioners provided little probative evidence on the relevant\n  question, i.e., whether midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs below the\n  level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does\n  not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by\n  the second and third drugs. Petitioners attempt to deflect attention\n  from their failure of proof on this point by criticizing the testimony of\n  the State’s expert. They emphasize an apparent conflict between the\n  State’s expert and their own expert regarding the biological process\n  that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect. But even if petitioners’ ex-\n  pert is correct regarding that biological process, it is largely beside\n  the point. What matters for present purposes is the dosage at which\n  the ceiling effect kicks in, not the biological process that produces the\n  effect. Pp. 22–25.\n       (4) Petitioners’ remaining arguments—that an expert report pre-\n  sented in the District Court should have been rejected because it ref-\n  erenced unreliable sources and contained an alleged mathematical\n  error, that only four States have used midazolam in an execution,\n  and that difficulties during two recent executions suggest that mid-\n  azolam is ineffective—all lack merit.

C. §1983, contending that the method of execution\nnow used by the State violates the Eighth Amendment\nbecause it creates an unacceptable risk of severe pain.\nThey argue that midazolam, the first drug employed in the\nState’s current three-drug protocol, fails to render a per-\nson insensate to pain. After holding an evidentiary hear-\ning, the District Court denied four prisoners’ application\nfor a preliminary injunction, finding that they had failed\nto prove that midazolam is ineffective.

Hanging remained\nthe standard method of execution through much of the\n19th century, but that began to change in the century’s\nlater years. See Baze, supra, at 41–42. In the 1880’s, the\nLegislature of the State of New York appointed a commis-\nsion to find “ ‘the most humane and practical method\nknown to modern science of carrying into effect the sen-\ntence of death in capital cases.’ ” In re Kemmler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92834\"><a href=\"/opinion/92834/in-re-kemmler/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (1890). The commission recommended electrocu-\ntion, and in 1888, the Legislature enacted a law providing\nfor this method of execution. Id., at 444–445.

See Baze, supra, at 42.\n  After Gregg reaffirmed that the death penalty does not\nviolate the Constitution, some States once again sought a\nmore humane way to carry out death sentences. They\neventually adopted lethal injection, which today is “by far\nthe most prevalent method of execution in the United\nStates.” Baze, supra, at 42. Oklahoma adopted lethal\ninjection in 1977, see 1977 Okla. Sess. Laws p. 89, and it\neventually settled on a protocol that called for the use of\nthree drugs: (1) sodium thiopental, “a fast-acting barbitu-\nrate sedative that induces a deep, comalike unconscious-\nness when given in the amounts used for lethal injection,”\n(2) a paralytic agent, which “inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respi-\nration,” and (3) potassium chloride, which “interferes with\nthe electrical signals that stimulate the contractions of the\nheart, inducing cardiac arrest.” Baze, supra, at 44; see\nalso Brief for Respondents 9.

Most recently, in Baze, supra, seven Jus-\ntices agreed that the three-drug protocol just discussed\ndoes not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our decisions in this area have been animated in part\nby the recognition that because it is settled that capital\npunishment is constitutional, “[i]t necessarily follows that\nthere must be a [constitutional] means of carrying it out.”\nId., at 47. And because some risk of pain is inherent in\nany method of execution, we have held that the Constitu-\ntion does not require the avoidance of all risk of pain.\nIbid. After all, while most humans wish to die a painless\ndeath, many do not have that good fortune. Holding that\nthe Eighth Amendment demands the elimination of essen-\ntially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death\npenalty altogether.\n                               B\n   Baze cleared any legal obstacle to use of the most com-\nmon three-drug protocol that had enabled States to carry\nout the death penalty in a quick and painless fashion. But\na practical obstacle soon emerged, as anti-death-penalty\nadvocates pressured pharmaceutical companies to refuse\nto supply the drugs used to carry out death sentences.\nThe sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the\nfirst drug used in the standard three-drug protocol, was\npersuaded to cease production of the drug. After suspend-\ning domestic production in 2009, the company planned to\nresume production in Italy. Koppel, Execution Drug Halt\nRaises Ire of Doctors, Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2011,\np. A6.

See\nHospira, Press Release, Hospira Statement Regarding\nPentothalTM (sodium thiopental) Market Exit (Jan. 21,\n2011).\n   After other efforts to procure sodium thiopental proved\nunsuccessful, States sought an alternative, and they even-\ntually replaced sodium thiopental with pentobarbital,\nanother barbiturate. In December 2010, Oklahoma be-\ncame the first State to execute an inmate using pentobar-\nbital. See Reuters, Chicago Tribune, New Drug Mix Used\nin Oklahoma Execution, Dec. 17 2010, p. 41.

In October 2013,\nFlorida became the first State to substitute midazolam for\npentobarbital as part of a three-drug lethal injection pro-\ntocol. Fernandez, Executions Stall As States Seek Differ-\nent Drugs, N. Y. Times, Nov. 9, 2013, p. A1.

In 2014, Oklahoma also\nsubstituted midazolam for pentobarbital as part of its\nthree-drug protocol. Oklahoma has already used this\nthree-drug protocol twice: to execute Clayton Lockett in\nApril 2014 and Charles Warner in January 2015. (Warner\nwas one of the four inmates who moved for a preliminary\ninjunction in this case.)\n  The Lockett execution caused Oklahoma to implement\nnew safety precautions as part of its lethal injection proto-\ncol. When Oklahoma executed Lockett, its protocol called\nfor the administration of 100 milligrams of midazolam, as\ncompared to the 500 milligrams that are currently re-\nquired. On the morning of his execution, Lockett cut\nhimself twice at “ ‘the bend of the elbow.’ ” App. 50. That\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

The team eventually\nbelieved that it had established intravenous access\nthrough Lockett’s right femoral vein, and it covered the\ninjection access point with a sheet, in part to preserve\nLockett’s dignity during the execution. After the team\nadministered the midazolam and a physician determined\nthat Lockett was unconscious, the team next administered\nthe paralytic agent (vecuronium bromide) and most of the\npotassium chloride. Lockett began to move and speak, at\nwhich point the physician lifted the sheet and determined\nthat the IV had “infiltrated,” which means that “the IV\nfluid, rather than entering Lockett’s blood stream, had\nleaked into the tissue surrounding the IV access point.”\nWarner v. Gross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (CA10 2015) (case\nbelow). The execution team stopped administering the\nremaining potassium chloride and terminated the execu-\ntion about 33 minutes after the midazolam was first in-\njected. About 10 minutes later, Lockett was pronounced\ndead.\n   An investigation into the Lockett execution concluded\nthat “the viability of the IV access point was the single\ngreatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in admin-\nistering the execution drugs.” App. 398. The investiga-\ntion, which took five months to complete, recommended\nseveral changes to Oklahoma’s execution protocol, and\nOklahoma adopted a new protocol with an effective date of\nSeptember 30, 2014. That protocol allows the Oklahoma\nDepartment of Corrections to choose among four different\ndrug combinations. The option that Oklahoma plans to\nuse to execute petitioners calls for the administration of\n500 milligrams of midazolam followed by a paralytic agent\n\f8                       GLOSSIP v.

The protocol also\nincludes procedural safeguards to help ensure that an\ninmate remains insensate to any pain caused by the ad-\nministration of the paralytic agent and potassium chlo-\nride. Those safeguards include: (1) the insertion of both a\nprimary and backup IV catheter, (2) procedures to confirm\nthe viability of the IV site, (3) the option to postpone an\nexecution if viable IV sites cannot be established within an\nhour, (4) a mandatory pause between administration of\nthe first and second drugs, (5) numerous procedures for\nmonitoring the offender’s consciousness, including the use\nof an electrocardiograph and direct observation, and\n(6) detailed provisions with respect to the training and\npreparation of the execution team. In January of this\nyear, Oklahoma executed Warner using these revised\nprocedures and the combination of midazolam, a paralytic\nagent, and potassium chloride.\n                            II\n\n\n                            A\n\n  In June 2014, after Oklahoma switched from pentobar-\nbital to midazolam and executed Lockett, 21 Oklahoma\ndeath row inmates filed an action under 42 U.

The District Court then held that petitioners failed\nto establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth\nAmendment. The court provided two independent reasons\nfor this conclusion. First, the court held that petitioners\nfailed to identify a known and available method of execu-\ntion that presented a substantially less severe risk of pain\nthan the method that the State proposed to use. Second,\nthe court found that petitioners failed to prove that Okla-\nhoma’s protocol “presents a risk that is ‘sure or very likely\nto cause serious illness and needless suffering,’ amounting\nto ‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” App. 96 (quot-\ning Baze, 553 U.

Baze involved a challenge by Kentucky death row\ninmates to that State’s three-drug lethal injection protocol\nof sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium\nchloride. The inmates conceded that the protocol, if\nproperly administered, would result in a humane and\nconstitutional execution because sodium thiopental would\nrender an inmate oblivious to any pain caused by the\nsecond and third drugs. 553 U.

The in-\nmates also maintained that a significant risk of harm\ncould be eliminated if Kentucky adopted a one-drug proto-\ncol and additional monitoring by trained personnel. Id., at\n51.\n   The controlling opinion in Baze first concluded that\nprisoners cannot successfully challenge a method of execu-\ntion unless they establish that the method presents a risk\nthat is “ ‘sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering,’ and give rise to ‘sufficiently imminent\ndangers.’ ” Id., at 50 (quoting Helling v.

The controlling opinion also stated that\nprisoners “cannot successfully challenge a State’s method\nof execution merely by showing a slightly or marginally\nsafer alternative.” 553 U. S., at 51. Instead, prisoners\nmust identify an alternative that is “feasible, readily\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

[And] [h]e\nmust show that the risk is substantial when compared to\nthe known and available alternatives.” Id., at 61. The\npreliminary injunction posture of the present case thus\nrequires petitioners to establish a likelihood that they can\nestablish both that Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol\ncreates a demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the\nrisk is substantial when compared to the known and\navailable alternatives.\n   The challenge in Baze failed both because the Kentucky\ninmates did not show that the risks they identified were\nsubstantial and imminent, id., at 56, and because they did\nnot establish the existence of a known and available alter-\nnative method of execution that would entail a significantly\nless severe risk, id., at 57–60. Petitioners’ arguments\nhere fail for similar reasons. First, petitioners have not\nproved that any risk posed by midazolam is substantial\nwhen compared to known and available alternative meth-\nods of execution. Second, they have failed to establish that\nthe District Court committed clear error when it found\nthat the use of midazolam will not result in severe pain\nand suffering. We address each reason in turn.\n                              IV\n  Our first ground for affirmance is based on petitioners’\nfailure to satisfy their burden of establishing that any risk\nof harm was substantial when compared to a known and\navailable alternative method of execution.          In their\namended complaint, petitioners proffered that the State\n\f14                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncould use sodium thiopental as part of a single-drug proto-\ncol. They have since suggested that it might also be con-\nstitutional for Oklahoma to use pentobarbital. But the\nDistrict Court found that both sodium thiopental and\npentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma’s De-\npartment of Corrections. The Court of Appeals affirmed\nthat finding, and it is not clearly erroneous. On the con-\ntrary, the record shows that Oklahoma has been unable to\nprocure those drugs despite a good-faith effort to do so.\n  Petitioners do not seriously contest this factual finding,\nand they have not identified any available drug or drugs\nthat could be used in place of those that Oklahoma is now\nunable to obtain. Nor have they shown a risk of pain so\ngreat that other acceptable, available methods must be\nused. Instead, they argue that they need not identify a\nknown and available method of execution that presents\nless risk. But this argument is inconsistent with the\ncontrolling opinion in Baze, 553 U. S., at 61, which im-\nposed a requirement that the Court now follows.2\n  Petitioners contend that the requirement to identify an\nalternative method of execution contravenes our pre-Baze\ndecision in Hill v. McDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145647\"><a href=\"/opinion/145647/hill-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), but\nthey misread that decision. The portion of the opinion in\nHill on which they rely concerned a question of civil pro-\ncedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment question. In\n\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent (hereinafter principal dissent), post, at\n24–25, inexplicably refuses to recognize that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s\nopinion in Baze sets out the holding of the case. In Baze, the opinion of\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was joined by two other JUSTICES. JUSTICES SCALIA\nand THOMAS took the broader position that a method of execution is\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment unless it is deliberately de-\nsigned to inflict pain. 553 U. S., at 94 (THOMAS, J. concurring in judg-\nment). Thus, as explained in Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n193 (1977), THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion sets out the holding of the\ncase. It is for this reason that petitioners base their argument on the\nrule set out in that opinion. See Brief for Petitioners 25, 28.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHill, the issue was whether a challenge to a method of\nexecution must be brought by means of an application for\na writ of habeas corpus or a civil action under §1983. Id.,\nat 576. We held that a method-of-execution claim must be\nbrought under §1983 because such a claim does not attack\nthe validity of the prisoner’s conviction or death sentence.\nId., at 579–580. The United States as amicus curiae\nargued that we should adopt a special pleading require-\nment to stop inmates from using §1983 actions to attack,\nnot just a particular means of execution, but the death\npenalty itself. To achieve this end, the United States\nproposed that an inmate asserting a method-of-execution\nclaim should be required to plead an acceptable alterna-\ntive method of execution. Id., at 582. We rejected that\nargument because “[s]pecific pleading requirements are\nmandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and\nnot, as a general rule, through case-by-case determina-\ntions of the federal courts.” Ibid. Hill thus held that\n§1983 alone does not impose a heightened pleading re-\nquirement. Baze, on the other hand, addressed the sub-\nstantive elements of an Eighth Amendment method-of-\nexecution claim, and it made clear that the Eighth\nAmendment requires a prisoner to plead and prove a\nknown and available alternative. Because petitioners\nfailed to do this, the District Court properly held that they\ndid not establish a likelihood of success on their Eighth\nAmendment claim.\n   Readers can judge for themselves how much distance\nthere is between the principal dissent’s argument against\nrequiring prisoners to identify an alternative and the\nview, now announced by JUSTICES BREYER and GINSBURG,\nthat the death penalty is categorically unconstitutional.\nPost, p. ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting). The principal dissent\ngoes out of its way to suggest that a State would violate\nthe Eighth Amendment if it used one of the methods of\nexecution employed before the advent of lethal injection.\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPost, at 30–31. And the principal dissent makes this\nsuggestion even though the Court held in Wilkerson that\nthis method (the firing squad) is constitutional and even\nthough, in the words of the principal dissent, “there is\nsome reason to think that it is relatively quick and pain-\nless.” Post, at 30. Tellingly silent about the methods of\nexecution most commonly used before States switched to\nlethal injection (the electric chair and gas chamber), the\nprincipal dissent implies that it would be unconstitutional\nto use a method that “could be seen as a devolution to a\nmore primitive era.” Ibid. If States cannot return to any\nof the “more primitive” methods used in the past and if no\ndrug that meets with the principal dissent’s approval is\navailable for use in carrying out a death sentence, the\nlogical conclusion is clear. But we have time and again\nreaffirmed that capital punishment is not per se unconsti-\ntutional. See, e.g., Baze, 553 U. S., at 47; id., at 87–88\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Gregg, 428 U. S., at\n187 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.);\nid., at 226 (White, J., concurring in judgment); Resweber,\n329 U. S., at 464; In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447; Wilker-\nson, 99 U. S., at 134–135. We decline to effectively over-\nrule these decisions.\n                            V\n  We also affirm for a second reason: The District Court\ndid not commit clear error when it found that midazolam\nis highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain\nduring an execution. We emphasize four points at the\noutset of our analysis.\n  First, we review the District Court’s factual findings\nunder the deferential “clear error” standard. This stand-\nard does not entitle us to overturn a finding “simply be-\ncause [we are] convinced that [we] would have decided the\ncase differently.” Anderson v.

Although petitioners\nexpend great effort attacking peripheral aspects of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony, they make little attempt to prove what\nis critical, i.e., that the evidence they presented to the\nDistrict Court establishes that the use of midazolam is\nsure or very likely to result in needless suffering.\n   Third, numerous courts have concluded that the use of\nmidazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is\nlikely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might\nresult from administration of the paralytic agent and\npotassium chloride.

GROSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprotocol if it violates the Eighth Amendment, federal\ncourts should not “embroil [themselves] in ongoing scien-\ntific controversies beyond their expertise.” Baze, supra, at\n51. Accordingly, an inmate challenging a protocol bears\nthe burden to show, based on evidence presented to the\ncourt, that there is a substantial risk of severe pain.\n                              A\n  Petitioners attack the District Court’s findings of fact on\ntwo main grounds.3 First, they argue that even if midazo-\nlam is powerful enough to induce unconsciousness, it is too\nweak to maintain unconsciousness and insensitivity to\npain once the second and third drugs are administered.\nSecond, while conceding that the 500-milligram dose of\nmidazolam is much higher than the normal therapeutic\ndose, they contend that this fact is irrelevant because\nmidazolam has a “ceiling effect”—that is, at a certain\npoint, an increase in the dose administered will not have\nany greater effect on the inmate. Neither argument\nsucceeds.\n  The District Court found that midazolam is capable of\nplacing a person “at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to\nresist the noxious stimuli which could occur from the\n\n——————\n   3 Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich, petitioners’ key witnesses, both testified\n\nthat midazolam is inappropriate for a third reason, namely, that it\ncreates a risk of “paradoxical reactions” such as agitation, hyperactiv-\nity, and combativeness. App. 175 (expert report of Dr. Lubarsky); id., at\n242, 244 (expert report of Dr. Sasich). The District Court found, how-\never, that the frequency with which a paradoxical reaction occurs “is\nspeculative” and that the risk “occurs with the highest frequency in low\ntherapeutic doses.” Id., at 78. Indeed, Dr. Sasich conceded that the\nincidence or risk of paradoxical reactions with midazolam “is unknown”\nand that reports estimate the risk to vary only “from 1% to above 10%.”\nId., at 244. Moreover, the mere fact that a method of execution might\nresult in some unintended side effects does not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation. “[T]he Constitution does not demand the avoid-\nance of all risk of pain.” Baze, 553 U. S., at 47 (plurality opinion).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of the second and third drugs.” App. 77. This\nconclusion was not clearly erroneous. Respondents’ ex-\npert, Dr. Evans, testified that the proper administration of\na 500-milligram dose of midazolam would make it “a\nvirtual certainty” that any individual would be “at a suffi-\ncient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli\nwhich could occur from application of the 2nd and 3rd\ndrugs” used in the Oklahoma protocol. Id., at 302; see also\nid., at 322. And petitioners’ experts acknowledged that\nthey had no contrary scientific proof. See id., at 243–244\n(Dr. Sasich stating that the ability of midazolam to render\na person insensate to the second and third drugs “has not\nbeen subjected to scientific testing”); id., at 176 (Dr.\nLubarksy stating that “there is no scientific literature\naddressing the use of midazolam as a manner to adminis-\nter lethal injections in humans”).\n  In an effort to explain this dearth of evidence, Dr. Sasich\ntestified that “[i]t’s not my responsibility or the [Food and\nDrug Administration’s] responsibility to prove that the\ndrug doesn’t work or is not safe.” Tr. of Preliminary In-\njunction Hearing 357 (Tr.). Instead, he stated, “it’s the\nresponsibility of the proponent to show that the drug is\nsafe and effective.” Ibid. Dr. Sasich confused the stand-\nard imposed on a drug manufacturer seeking approval of a\ntherapeutic drug with the standard that must be borne by\na party challenging a State’s lethal injection protocol.\nWhen a method of execution is authorized under state law,\na party contending that this method violates the Eighth\nAmendment bears the burden of showing that the method\ncreates an unacceptable risk of pain. Here, petitioners’\nown experts effectively conceded that they lacked evidence\nto prove their case beyond dispute.\n  Petitioners attempt to avoid this deficiency by criticizing\nrespondents’ expert. They argue that the District Court\nshould not have credited Dr. Evans’ testimony because he\nadmitted that his findings were based on “ ‘extrapo-\n\f20                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlat[ions]’ ” from studies done about much lower therapeutic\ndoses of midazolam. See Brief for Petitioners 34 (citing Tr.\n667–668; emphasis deleted). But because a 500-milligram\ndose is never administered for a therapeutic purpose,\nextrapolation was reasonable. And the conclusions of\npetitioners’ experts were also based on extrapolations and\nassumptions. For example, Dr. Lubarsky relied on “ex-\ntrapolation of the ceiling effect data.” App. 177.\n   Based on the evidence that the parties presented to the\nDistrict Court, we must affirm. Testimony from both sides\nsupports the District Court’s conclusion that midazolam\ncan render a person insensate to pain. Dr. Evans testified\nthat although midazolam is not an analgesic, it can none-\ntheless “render the person unconscious and ‘insen-\nsate’ during the remainder of the procedure.” Id., at 294.\nIn his discussion about the ceiling effect, Dr. Sasich agreed\nthat as the dose of midazolam increases, it is “expected to\nproduce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to\nstimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).” Id., at 243.\nPetitioners argue that midazolam is not powerful enough\nto keep a person insensate to pain after the administration\nof the second and third drugs, but Dr. Evans presented\ncreditable testimony to the contrary. See, e.g., Tr. 661\n(testifying that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will\ninduce a coma).4 Indeed, low doses of midazolam are\nsufficient to induce unconsciousness and are even some-\n\n\n——————\n   4 The principal dissent misunderstands the record when it bizarrely\n\nsuggests that midazolam is about as dangerous as a peanut. Post, at\n15. Dr. Evans and Dr. Lubarsky agreed that midazolam has caused\nfatalities in doses as low as 0.04 to 0.07 milligrams per kilogram. App.\n217, 294. Even if death from such low doses is a “rare, unfortunate side\neffec[t],” post, at 15, the District Court found that a massive 500-\nmilligram dose—many times higher than the lowest dose reported to\nhave produced death—will likely cause death in under an hour.

Dr. Sasich conceded, for example, that mid-\nazolam might be used for medical procedures like colonos-\ncopies and gastroscopies. App. 267–268; see also Brief for\nRespondents 6–8.5\n  Petitioners emphasize that midazolam is not recom-\nmended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during\npainful surgery, but there are two reasons why this is not\ndispositive. First, as the District Court found, the 500-\nmilligram dose at issue here “is many times higher than a\nnormal therapeutic dose of midazolam.” App. 76. The\neffect of a small dose of midazolam has minimal probative\nvalue about the effect of a 500-milligram dose. Second, the\nfact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for\nmaintaining unconsciousness during surgery says little\nabout whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is\nconstitutionally adequate for purposes of conducting an\nexecution. We recognized this point in Baze, where we\nconcluded that although the medical standard of care\nmight require the use of a blood pressure cuff and an\nelectrocardiogram during surgeries, this does not mean\nthose procedures are required for an execution to pass\nEighth Amendment scrutiny. 553 U. S., at 60.\n  Oklahoma has also adopted important safeguards to\nensure that midazolam is properly administered. The\n\n——————\n  5 Petitioners’experts also declined to testify that a 500-milligram\ndose of midazolam is always insufficient to place a person in a coma\nand render him insensate to pain. Dr. Lubarsky argued only that the\n500-milligram dose cannot “reliably” produce a coma. Id., 228. And\nwhen Dr. Sasich was asked whether he could say to a reasonable\ndegree of certainty that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would not\nrender someone unconscious, he replied that he could not. Id., at 271–\n272. A product label for midazolam that Dr. Sasich attached to his\nexpert report also acknowledged that an overdose of midazolam can\ncause a coma. See Expert Report of Larry D. Sasich, in No. 14–6244\n(CA10), p. 34.\n\f22                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court emphasized three requirements in particu-\nlar: The execution team must secure both a primary and\nbackup IV access site, it must confirm the viability of the\nIV sites, and it must continuously monitor the offender’s\nlevel of consciousness. The District Court did not commit\nclear error in concluding that these safeguards help to\nminimize any risk that might occur in the event that\nmidazolam does not operate as intended. Indeed, we\nconcluded in Baze that many of the safeguards that Okla-\nhoma employs—including the establishment of a primary\nand backup IV and the presence of personnel to monitor\nan inmate—help in significantly reducing the risk that an\nexecution protocol will violate the Eighth Amendment.\nId., at 55–56. And many other safeguards that Oklahoma\nhas adopted mirror those that the dissent in Baze com-\nplained were absent from Kentucky’s protocol in that case.\nFor example, the dissent argued that because a conscious-\nness check before injection of the second drug “can reduce\na risk of dreadful pain,” Kentucky’s failure to include that\nstep in its procedure was unconstitutional. Id., at 119\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The dissent also complained\nthat Kentucky did not monitor the effectiveness of the first\ndrug or pause between injection of the first and second\ndrugs. Id., at 120–121. Oklahoma has accommodated\neach of those concerns.\n                              B\n   Petitioners assert that midazolam’s “ceiling effect”\nundermines the District Court’s finding about the effec-\ntiveness of the huge dose administered in the Oklahoma\nprotocol. Petitioners argue that midazolam has a “ceiling”\nabove which any increase in dosage produces no effect. As\na result, they maintain, it is wrong to assume that a 500-\nmilligram dose has a much greater effect than a therapeu-\ntic dose of about 5 milligrams. But the mere fact that\nmidazolam has such a ceiling cannot be dispositive. Dr.\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSasich testified that “all drugs essentially have a ceiling\neffect.” Tr. 343. The relevant question here is whether\nmidazolam’s ceiling effect occurs below the level of a 500-\nmilligram dose and at a point at which the drug does not\nhave the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain\ncaused by the second and third drugs.\n   Petitioners provided little probative evidence on this\npoint, and the speculative evidence that they did present\nto the District Court does not come close to establishing\nthat its factual findings were clearly erroneous.\nDr. Sasich stated in his expert report that the literature\n“indicates” that midazolam has a ceiling effect, but he\nconceded that he “was unable to determine the midazolam\ndose for a ceiling effect on unconsciousness because there\nis no literature in which such testing has been done.” App.\n243–244. Dr. Lubarsky’s report was similar, id., at 171–\n172, and the testimony of petitioners’ experts at the hear-\ning was no more compelling. Dr. Sasich frankly admitted\nthat he did a “search to try and determine at what dose of\nmidazolam you would get a ceiling effect,” but concluded:\n“I could not find one.” Tr. 344. The closest petitioners\ncame was Dr. Lubarsky’s suggestion that the ceiling effect\noccurs “[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams,” but\nhe added that he had not actually done the relevant calcu-\nlations, and he admitted: “I can’t tell you right now” at\nwhat dose the ceiling effect occurs. App. 225. We cannot\nconclude that the District Court committed clear error in\ndeclining to find, based on such speculative evidence, that\nthe ceiling effect negates midazolam’s ability to render an\ninmate insensate to pain caused by the second and third\ndrugs in the protocol.\n   The principal dissent discusses the ceiling effect at\nlength, but it studiously avoids suggesting that petitioners\npresented probative evidence about the dose at which the\nceiling effect occurs or about whether the effect occurs\nbefore a person becomes insensate to pain.

GROSS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent avoids these critical issues by suggesting that such\nevidence is “irrelevant if there is no dose at which the drug\ncan . . . render a person ‘insensate to pain.’ ” Post, at 17.\nBut the District Court heard evidence that the drug can\nrender a person insensate to pain, and not just from Dr.\nEvans: Dr. Sasich (one of petitioners’ own experts) testi-\nfied that higher doses of midazolam are “expected to pro-\nduce . . . lack of response to stimuli such as pain.” App.\n243.6\n   In their brief, petitioners attempt to deflect attention\nfrom their failure of proof regarding midazolam’s ceiling\neffect by criticizing Dr. Evans’ testimony. But it was\npetitioners’ burden to establish that midazolam’s ceiling\noccurred at a dosage below the massive 500-milligram\ndose employed in the Oklahoma protocol and at a point at\nwhich the drug failed to render the recipient insensate to\npain. They did not meet that burden, and their criticisms\ndo not undermine Dr. Evans’ central point, which the\nDistrict Court credited, that a properly administered 500-\nmilligram dose of midazolam will render the recipient\nunable to feel pain.\n   One of petitioners’ criticisms of Dr. Evans’ testimony is\nlittle more than a quibble about the wording chosen by Dr.\nEvans at one point in his oral testimony. Petitioners’\nexpert, Dr. Lubarsky, stated in his report that midazolam\n“increases effective binding of [gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(GABA)] to its receptor to induce unconsciousness.”7 App.\n——————\n  6 The principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s supposedly contra-\n\nry testimony, but the District Court was entitled to credit Dr. Evans\n(and Dr. Sasich) instead of Dr. Lubarsky on this point. And the District\nCourt had strong reasons not to credit Dr. Lubarsky, who even argued\nthat a protocol that includes sodium thiopental is “constructed to\nproduce egregious harm and suffering.” App. 227.\n  7 GABA is “an amino acid that functions as an inhibitory neuro-\n\ntransmitter in the brain and spinal cord.” Mosby’s Medical Dictionary\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U.

Dr. Evans’ report provided a similar explanation of\nthe way in which midazolam works, see id., at 293–294,\nand Dr. Lubarsky did not dispute the accuracy of that\nexplanation when he testified at the hearing. Petitioners\ncontend, however, that Dr. Evans erred when he said at\nthe hearing that “[m]idazolam attaches to GABA recep-\ntors, inhibiting GABA.” Id., at 312 (emphasis added).\nPetitioners contend that this statement was incorrect\nbecause “far from inhibiting GABA, midazolam facilitates\nits binding to GABA receptors.” Brief for Petitioners 38.\n   In making this argument, petitioners are simply quar-\nrelling with the words that Dr. Evans used during oral\ntestimony in an effort to explain how midazolam works in\nterms understandable to a layman. Petitioners do not\nsuggest that the discussion of midazolam in Dr. Evans’\nexpert report was inaccurate, and as for Dr. Evans’ pass-\ning use of the term “inhibiting,” Dr. Lubarksy’s own expert\nreport states that GABA’s “inhibition of brain activity is\naccentuated by midazolam.” App. 232 (emphasis added).\nDr. Evans’ oral use of the word “inhibiting”—particularly\nin light of his written testimony—does not invalidate the\nDistrict Court’s decision to rely on his testimony.\n   Petitioners also point to an apparent conflict between\nDr. Evans’ testimony and a declaration by Dr. Lubarsky\n(submitted after the District Court ruled) regarding the\nbiological process that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nBut even if Dr. Lubarsky’s declaration is correct, it is\nlargely beside the point. What matters for present pur-\nposes is the dosage at which the ceiling effect kicks in, not\nthe biological process that produces the effect. And Dr.\nLubarsky’s declaration does not render the District Court’s\nfindings clearly erroneous with respect to that critical\nissue.\n\n——————\n782 (7th ed. 2006).\n\f26                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ remaining arguments about midazolam all\nlack merit. First, we are not persuaded by petitioners’\nargument that Dr. Evans’ testimony should have been\nrejected because of some of the sources listed in his report.\nPetitioners criticize two of the “selected references” that\nDr. Evans cited in his expert report: the Web site\ndrugs.com and a material safety data sheet (MSDS) about\nmidazolam. Petitioners’ argument is more of a Daubert\nchallenge to Dr. Evans’ testimony than an argument that\nthe District Court’s findings were clearly erroneous. The\nDistrict Court concluded that Dr. Evans was “well-\nqualified to give the expert testimony that he gave” and\nthat “his testimony was the product of reliable principles\nand methods reliably applied to the facts of this case.”\nApp. 75–76. To the extent that the reliability of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony is even before us, the District Court’s con-\nclusion that his testimony was based on reliable sources is\nreviewed under the deferential “abuse-of-discretion”\nstandard. General Elec. Co. v.

Dr. Evans relied on multiple sources and his\nown expertise, and his testimony may not be disqualified\nsimply because one source (drugs.com) warns that it “ ‘is\nnot intended for medical advice’ ” and another (the MSDS)\nstates that its information is provided “ ‘without any war-\nranty, express or implied, regarding its correctness.’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners 36. Medical journals that both par-\nties rely upon typically contain similar disclaimers. See,\ne.g., Anesthesiology, Terms and Conditions of Use, online\nat       http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/ss/terms.aspx\n(“None of the information on this Site shall be used to\ndiagnose or treat any health problem or disease”). Dr.\nLubarsky—petitioners’ own expert—relied on an MSDS to\nargue that midazolam has a ceiling effect. And petitioners\ndo not identify any incorrect statements from drugs.com\non which Dr. Evans relied. In fact, although Dr. Sasich\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubmitted a declaration to the Court of Appeals criticizing\nDr. Evans’ reference to drugs.com, that declaration does\nnot identify a single fact from that site’s discussion of\nmidazolam that was materially inaccurate.\n   Second, petitioners argue that Dr. Evans’ expert report\ncontained a mathematical error, but we find this argu-\nment insignificant. Dr. Evans stated in his expert report\nthat the lowest dose of midazolam resulting in human\ndeaths, according to an MSDS, is 0.071 mg/kg delivered\nintravenously. App. 294. Dr. Lubarsky agreed with this\nstatement. Specifically, he testified that fatalities have\noccurred in doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg, and he\nstated that Dr. Evans’ testimony to that effect was “a true\nstatement” (though he added those fatalities occurred\namong the elderly). Id., at 217. We do not understand\npetitioners to dispute the testimony of Dr. Evans and their\nown expert that 0.071 mg/kg is a potentially fatal dose of\nmidazolam. Instead, they make much of the fact that the\nMSDS attached to Dr. Evans’ report apparently contained\na typographical error and reported the lowest toxic dose as\n71 mg/kg. That Dr. Evans did not repeat that incorrect\nfigure but instead reported the correct dose supports\nrather than undermines his testimony. In any event, the\nalleged error in the MSDS is irrelevant because the Dis-\ntrict Court expressly stated that it did not rely on the\nfigure in the MSDS. See id., at 75.\n   Third, petitioners argue that there is no consensus\namong the States regarding midazolam’s efficacy because\nonly four States (Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio)\nhave used midazolam as part of an execution. Petitioners\nrely on the plurality’s statement in Baze that “it is difficult\nto regard a practice as ‘objectively intolerable’ when it is in\nfact widely tolerated,” and the plurality’s emphasis on the\nfact that 36 States had adopted lethal injection and 30\nStates used the particular three-drug protocol at issue in\nthat case. 553 U. S., at 53. But while the near-universal\n\f28                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of the particular protocol at issue in Baze supported\nour conclusion that this protocol did not violate the Eighth\nAmendment, we did not say that the converse was true,\ni.e., that other protocols or methods of execution are of\ndoubtful constitutionality. That argument, if accepted,\nwould hamper the adoption of new and potentially more\nhumane methods of execution and would prevent States\nfrom adapting to changes in the availability of suitable\ndrugs.\n   Fourth, petitioners argue that difficulties with Oklaho-\nma’s execution of Lockett and Arizona’s July 2014 execu-\ntion of Joseph Wood establish that midazolam is sure or\nvery likely to cause serious pain. We are not persuaded.\nAside from the Lockett execution, 12 other executions\nhave been conducted using the three-drug protocol at issue\nhere, and those appear to have been conducted without\nany significant problems. See Brief for Respondents 32;\nBrief for State of Florida as Amicus Curiae 1. Moreover,\nLockett was administered only 100 milligrams of midazo-\nlam, and Oklahoma’s investigation into that execution\nconcluded that the difficulties were due primarily to the\nexecution team’s inability to obtain an IV access site. And\nthe Wood execution did not involve the protocol at issue\nhere. Wood did not receive a single dose of 500 milligrams\nof midazolam; instead, he received fifteen 50-milligram\ndoses over the span of two hours.8 Brief for Respondents\n——————\n  8 The  principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s testimony that it is\nirrelevant that Wood was administered the drug over a 2-hour period.\nPost, at 20. But Dr. Evans disagreed and testified that if a 750-\nmilligram dose “was spread out over a long period of time,” such as one\nhour (i.e., half the time at issue in the Wood execution), the drug might\nnot be as effective as if it were administered all at once. Tr. 667. The\nprincipal dissent states that this “pronouncement was entirely unsup-\nported,” post, at 20, n. 6, but it was supported by Dr. Evans’ expertise\nand decades of experience. And it would be unusual for an expert\ntestifying on the stand to punctuate each sentence with citation to a\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U.

And Arizona used a different two-drug protocol\nthat paired midazolam with hydromorphone, a drug that\nis not at issue in this case. Ibid. When all of the circum-\nstances are considered, the Lockett and Wood executions\nhave little probative value for present purposes.\n   Finally, we find it appropriate to respond to the princi-\npal dissent’s groundless suggestion that our decision is\ntantamount to allowing prisoners to be “drawn and quar-\ntered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the\nstake.” Post, at 28. That is simply not true, and the prin-\ncipal dissent’s resort to this outlandish rhetoric reveals the\nweakness of its legal arguments.\n                              VI\n  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nmedical journal.\n  After the Wood execution, Arizona commissioned an independent\nassessment of its execution protocol and the Wood execution.

And far from\nblaming midazolam for the Wood execution, the report recommended\nthat Arizona replace its two-drug protocol with Oklahoma’s three-drug\nprotocol that includes a 500-milligram dose of midazolam as the first\ndrug.

The scene is familiar:\nPetitioners, sentenced to die for the crimes they committed\n(including, in the case of one petitioner since put to death,\nraping and murdering an 11–month-old baby), come before\nthis Court asking us to nullify their sentences as “cruel\nand unusual” under the Eighth Amendment. They rely on\nthis provision because it is the only provision they can rely\non. They were charged by a sovereign State with murder.\nThey were afforded counsel and tried before a jury of their\npeers—tried twice, once to determine whether they were\nguilty and once to determine whether death was the ap-\npropriate sentence. They were duly convicted and sen-\ntenced. They were granted the right to appeal and to seek\npostconviction relief, first in state and then in federal\ncourt. And now, acknowledging that their convictions are\nunassailable, they ask us for clemency, as though clemency\nwere ours to give.\n   The response is also familiar: A vocal minority of the\nCourt, waving over their heads a ream of the most recent\nabolitionist studies (a superabundant genre) as though\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthey have discovered the lost folios of Shakespeare, insist\nthat now, at long last, the death penalty must be abolished\nfor good. Mind you, not once in the history of the Ameri-\ncan Republic has this Court ever suggested the death\npenalty is categorically impermissible. The reason is\nobvious: It is impossible to hold unconstitutional that\nwhich the Constitution explicitly contemplates. The Fifth\nAmendment provides that “[n]o person shall be held to\nanswer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or\nindictment of a Grand Jury,” and that no person shall be\n“deprived of life . . . without due process of law.” Never-\ntheless, today JUSTICE BREYER takes on the role of the\nabolitionists in this long-running drama, arguing that the\ntext of the Constitution and two centuries of history must\nyield to his “20 years of experience on this Court,” and\ninviting full briefing on the continued permissibility of\ncapital punishment, post, at 2 (dissenting opinion).\n  Historically, the Eighth Amendment was understood to\nbar only those punishments that added “ ‘terror, pain, or\ndisgrace’ ” to an otherwise permissible capital sentence.\nBaze v. Rees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145817\"><a href=\"/opinion/145817/baze-v-rees/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Rather than bother with this troubling\ndetail, JUSTICE BREYER elects to contort the constitutional\ntext. Redefining “cruel” to mean “unreliable,” “arbitrary,”\nor causing “excessive delays,” and “unusual” to include a\n“decline in use,” he proceeds to offer up a white paper\ndevoid of any meaningful legal argument.\n  Even accepting JUSTICE BREYER’s rewriting of the\nEighth Amendment, his argument is full of internal con-\ntradictions and (it must be said) gobbledy-gook. He says\nthat the death penalty is cruel because it is unreliable; but\nit is convictions, not punishments, that are unreliable.\nMoreover, the “pressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors\nto secure a conviction,” which he claims increases the risk\nof wrongful convictions in capital cases, flows from the\nnature of the crime, not the punishment that follows its\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges as\nmuch: “[T]he crimes at issue in capital cases are typically\nhorrendous murders, and thus accompanied by intense\ncommunity pressure.” Ibid. That same pressure would\nexist, and the same risk of wrongful convictions, if horren-\ndous death-penalty cases were converted into equally\nhorrendous life-without-parole cases. The reality is that\nany innocent defendant is infinitely better off appealing a\ndeath sentence than a sentence of life imprisonment.\n(Which, again, JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges: “[C]ourts\n(or State Governors) are 130 times more likely to exoner-\nate a defendant where a death sentence is at issue,” post,\nat 5.) The capital convict will obtain endless legal assis-\ntance from the abolition lobby (and legal favoritism from\nabolitionist judges), while the lifer languishes unnoticed\nbehind bars.\n   JUSTICE BREYER next says that the death penalty is\ncruel because it is arbitrary. To prove this point, he points\nto a study of 205 cases that “measured the ‘egregiousness’\nof the murderer’s conduct” with “a system of metrics,” and\nthen “compared the egregiousness of the conduct of the 9\ndefendants sentenced to death with the egregiousness of\nthe conduct of defendants in the remaining 196 cases [who\nwere not sentenced to death],” post, at 10–11. If only\nAristotle, Aquinas, and Hume knew that moral philosophy\ncould be so neatly distilled into a pocket-sized, vade me-\ncum “system of metrics.” Of course it cannot: Egregious-\nness is a moral judgment susceptible of few hard-and-fast\nrules. More importantly, egregiousness of the crime is\nonly one of several factors that render a punishment con-\ndign—culpability, rehabilitative potential, and the need\nfor deterrence also are relevant. That is why this Court\nhas required an individualized consideration of all miti-\ngating circumstances, rather than formulaic application of\nsome egregiousness test.\n   It is because these questions are contextual and admit of\n\f4                     GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nno easy answers that we rely on juries to make judgments\nabout the people and crimes before them. The fact that\nthese judgments may vary across cases is an inevitable\nconsequence of the jury trial, that cornerstone of Anglo-\nAmerican judicial procedure. But when a punishment is\nauthorized by law—if you kill you are subject to death—\nthe fact that some defendants receive mercy from their\njury no more renders the underlying punishment “cruel”\nthan does the fact that some guilty individuals are never\napprehended, are never tried, are acquitted, or are\npardoned.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s third reason that the death penalty is\ncruel is that it entails delay, thereby (1) subjecting in-\nmates to long periods on death row and (2) undermining\nthe penological justifications of the death penalty. The\nfirst point is nonsense. Life without parole is an even\nlengthier period than the wait on death row; and if the\nobjection is that death row is a more confining environ-\nment, the solution should be modifying the environment\nrather than abolishing the death penalty. As for the\nargument that delay undermines the penological ration-\nales for the death penalty: In insisting that “the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates,” post, at\n24, JUSTICE BREYER apparently forgets that one of the\nplaintiffs in this very case was already in prison when he\ncommitted the murder that landed him on death row.\nJUSTICE BREYER further asserts that “whatever interest in\nretribution might be served by the death penalty as cur-\nrently administered, that interest can be served almost as\nwell by a sentence of life in prison without parole,” post, at\n27. My goodness. If he thinks the death penalty not much\nmore harsh (and hence not much more retributive), why is\nhe so keen to get rid of it? With all due respect, whether\nthe death penalty and life imprisonment constitute more-\nor-less equivalent retribution is a question far above the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\njudiciary’s pay grade. Perhaps JUSTICE BREYER is more\nforgiving—or more enlightened—than those who, like\nKant, believe that death is the only just punishment for\ntaking a life. I would not presume to tell parents whose\nlife has been forever altered by the brutal murder of a\nchild that life imprisonment is punishment enough.\n   And finally, JUSTICE BREYER speculates that it does not\n“seem likely” that the death penalty has a “significant”\ndeterrent effect. Post, at 25. It seems very likely to me,\nand there are statistical studies that say so. See, e.g.,\nZimmerman, State Executions, Deterrence, and the Inci-\ndence of Murder, 7 J. Applied Econ. 163, 166 (2004) (“[I]t\nis estimated that each state execution deters approximately\nfourteen murders per year on average”); Dezhbakhsh,\nRubin, & Shepherd, Does Capital Punishment Have a\nDeterrent Effect? New Evidence from Postmoratorium\nPanel Data, 5 Am. L. & Econ. Rev. 344 (2003) (“[E]ach\nexecution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders”\nper year); Sunstein & Vermeule, Is Capital Punishment\nMorally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life\nTradeoffs, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2005) (“All in all, the\nrecent evidence of a deterrent effect from capital punish-\nment seems impressive, especially in light of its ‘apparent\npower and unanimity’ ”). But we federal judges live in a\nworld apart from the vast majority of Americans. After\nwork, we retire to homes in placid suburbia or to high-rise\nco-ops with guards at the door. We are not confronted\nwith the threat of violence that is ever present in many\nAmericans’ everyday lives. The suggestion that the in-\ncremental deterrent effect of capital punishment does not\nseem “significant” reflects, it seems to me, a let-them-eat-\ncake obliviousness to the needs of others. Let the People\ndecide how much incremental deterrence is appropriate.\n   Of course, this delay is a problem of the Court’s own\nmaking. As JUSTICE BREYER concedes, for more than 160\nyears, capital sentences were carried out in an average of\n\f6                    GLOSSIP v.

What happened in the intervening years?\nNothing other than the proliferation of labyrinthine re-\nstrictions on capital punishment, promulgated by this\nCourt under an interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\nthat empowered it to divine “the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society,”\nTrop v. Dulles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105659\"><a href=\"/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1958) (plurality opin-\nion)—a task for which we are eminently ill suited. Indeed,\nfor the past two decades, JUSTICE BREYER has been the\nDrum Major in this parade. His invocation of the result-\nant delay as grounds for abolishing the death penalty calls\nto mind the man sentenced to death for killing his parents,\nwho pleads for mercy on the ground that he is an orphan.\nAmplifying the surrealism of his argument, JUSTICE\nBREYER uses the fact that many States have abandoned\ncapital punishment—have abandoned it precisely because\nof the costs those suspect decisions have imposed—to\nconclude that it is now “unusual.” Post, at 33–39. (A\ncaution to the reader: Do not use the creative arithmetic\nthat JUSTICE BREYER employs in counting the number of\nStates that use the death penalty when you prepare your\nnext tax return; outside the world of our Eighth Amend-\nment abolitionist-inspired jurisprudence, it will be regarded\nas more misrepresentation than math.)\n   If we were to travel down the path that JUSTICE BREYER\nsets out for us and once again consider the constitutionality\nof the death penalty, I would ask that counsel also brief\nwhether our cases that have abandoned the historical\nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, beginning with\nTrop, should be overruled. That case has caused more\nmischief to our jurisprudence, to our federal system, and\nto our society than any other that comes to mind. JUSTICE\nBREYER’s dissent is the living refutation of Trop’s assump-\ntion that this Court has the capacity to recognize “evolving\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Time and again, this Court has\nupheld that decision. And time and again, a vocal minor-\nity of this Court has insisted that things have “changed\nradically,” post, at 2, and has sought to replace the judg-\nments of the People with their own standards of decency.\n   Capital punishment presents moral questions that\nphilosophers, theologians, and statesmen have grappled\nwith for millennia. The Framers of our Constitution\ndisagreed bitterly on the matter.

His conclusion is based on an analysis\nthat itself provides a powerful case against enforcing an\nimaginary constitutional rule against “arbitrariness.”\n   The thrust of JUSTICE BREYER’s argument is that empir-\nical studies performed by death penalty abolitionists\nreveal that the assignment of death sentences does not\nnecessarily correspond to the “egregiousness” of the\ncrimes, but instead appears to be correlated to “arbitrary”\nfactors, such as the locality in which the crime was com-\nmitted. Relying on these studies to determine the consti-\ntutionality of the death penalty fails to respect the values\nimplicit in the Constitution’s allocation of decisionmaking\nin this context. The Donohue study, on which JUSTICE\nBREYER relies most heavily, measured the “egregiousness”\n(or “deathworthiness”) of murders by asking lawyers to\nidentify the legal grounds for aggravation in each case,\nand by asking law students to evaluate written summaries\nof the murders and assign “egregiousness” scores based on\na rubric designed to capture and standardize their moral\njudgments. Donohue, An Empirical Evaluation of the\nConnecticut Death Penalty System Since 1973, Are There\nUnlawful Racial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities? 11\nJ. of Empirical Legal Studies 637, 644–645 (2014). This\nexercise in some ways approximates the function per-\nformed by jurors, but there is at least one critical differ-\nence: The law students make their moral judgments based\non written summaries—they do not sit through hours,\ndays, or weeks of evidence detailing the crime; they do not\nhave an opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses,\nto see the remorse of the defendant, to feel the impact of\nthe crime on the victim’s family; they do not bear the\nburden of deciding the fate of another human being; and\nthey are not drawn from the community whose sense of\nsecurity and justice may have been torn asunder by an act\nof callous disregard for human life. They are like appel-\n\f4                         GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nlate judges and justices, reviewing only a paper record of\neach side’s case for life or death.\n   There is a reason the choice between life and death,\nwithin legal limits, is left to the jurors and judges who sit\nthrough the trial, and not to legal elites (or law students).2\nThat reason is memorialized not once, but twice, in our\nConstitution: Article III guarantees that “[t]he Trial of all\nCrimes, except in cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury”\nand that “such Trial shall be held in the State where the\nsaid Crimes shall have been committed.” Art. III, §2, cl. 3.\nAnd the Sixth Amendment promises that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . .\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\nthe crime shall have been committed.” Those provisions\nensure that capital defendants are given the option to be\nsentenced by a jury of their peers who, collectively, are\nbetter situated to make the moral judgment between life\nand death than are the products of contemporary Ameri-\ncan law schools.\n   It should come as no surprise, then, that the primary\nexplanation a regression analysis revealed for the gap\nbetween the egregiousness scores and the actual sentences\nwas not the race or sex of the offender or victim, but the\nlocality in which the crime was committed.

One such\nstudy’s explanation of how the author assigned “depravity\npoints” to identify the “worst of the worst” murderers\nproves the point well. McCord, Lightning Still Strikes, 71\nBrooklyn L. Rev. 797, 833–834 (2005). Each aggravating\nfactor received a point value based on the “blame-\nworth[iness]” of the action associated with it. Id., at 830.\nKilling a prison guard, for instance, earned a defendant\nthree “depravity points” because it improved the case for\ncomplete incapacitation, while killing a police officer\nmerited only two, because, “considered dispassionately,”\nsuch acts do “not seem be a sine qua non of the worst\ncriminals.” Id., at 834–836. (Do not worry, the author\nreassures us, “many killers of police officers accrue de-\npravity points in other ways that clearly put them among\nthe worst criminals.” Id., at 836.) Killing a child under\nthe age of 12 was worth two depravity points, because\nsuch an act “seems particularly heartless,” but killing\nsomeone over the age of 70 earned the murderer only one,\nfor although “elderly victims tug at our hearts,” they do so\n“less” than children “because the promise of a long life is\nless.” Id., at 836, 838. Killing to make a political state-\nment was worth three depravity points; killing out of\nracial hatred, only two. Id., at 835, 837.

He shot his father\nand his father’s girlfriend pointblank in the face as they\npleaded for their lives. Id., at 5–6. He then tracked the\ngirls down in their hiding places and slit their throats,\nleaving them alive for several minutes as they drowned in\ntheir own blood. Id., at 6–7.\n   Whatever one’s views on the permissibility or wisdom of\nthe death penalty, I doubt anyone would disagree that\neach of these crimes was egregious enough to merit the\nseverest condemnation that society has to offer.

The circumstances and the evidence of the\ndeath penalty’s application have changed radically since\nthen. Given those changes, I believe that it is now time to\nreopen the question.\n   In 1976, the Court thought that the constitutional in­\nfirmities in the death penalty could be healed; the Court in\neffect delegated significant responsibility to the States to\ndevelop procedures that would protect against those con­\nstitutional problems. Almost 40 years of studies, surveys,\nand experience strongly indicate, however, that this effort\nhas failed. Today’s administration of the death penalty\ninvolves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1)\nserious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and\n(3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death\npenalty’s penological purpose. Perhaps as a result, (4)\nmost places within the United States have abandoned its\nuse.\n   I shall describe each of these considerations, emphasiz­\ning changes that have occurred during the past four dec­\nades. For it is those changes, taken together with my own\n20 years of experience on this Court, that lead me to be­\nlieve that the death penalty, in and of itself, now likely\nconstitutes a legally prohibited “cruel and unusual pun­\nishmen[t].” U. S.

That “qualita­\ntive difference” creates “a corresponding difference in the\nneed for reliability in the determination that death is the\nappropriate punishment in a specific case.” Ibid. There is\nincreasing evidence, however, that the death penalty as\nnow applied lacks that requisite reliability. Cf.

See, e.g., Liebman, Fatal Injustice;\nCarlos DeLuna’s Execution Shows That a Faster, Cheaper\nDeath Penalty is a Dangerous Idea, L. A. Times, June 1,\n2012, p. A19 (describing results of a 4-year investigation,\nlater published as The Wrong Carlos: Anatomy of a\nWrongful Execution (2014), that led its authors to con­\nclude that Carlos DeLuna, sentenced to death and executed\nin 1989, six years after his arrest in Texas for stabbing\na single mother to death in a convenience store, was inno­\ncent); Grann, Trial By Fire: Did Texas Execute An Inno­\ncent Man? The New Yorker, Sept. 7, 2009, p. 42 (describ­\ning evidence that Cameron Todd Willingham was\nconvicted, and ultimately executed in 2004, for the appar­\nently motiveless murder of his three children as the result\nof invalid scientific analysis of the scene of the house fire\nthat killed his children).

As of 2002, this Court used the word “disturb­\ning” to describe the number of instances in which individ­\nuals had been sentenced to death but later exonerated. At\nthat time, there was evidence of approximately 60\nexonerations in capital cases.       Atkins, 536 U. S., at\n320, n. 25; National Registry of Exonerations, online at\nhttp://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.\naspx (all Internet materials as visited June 25, 2015, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). (I use “exonera­\ntion” to refer to relief from all legal consequences of a\ncapital conviction through a decision by a prosecutor, a\nGovernor or a court, after new evidence of the defendant’s\ninnocence was discovered.) Since 2002, the number of\nexonerations in capital cases has risen to 115.

DNA evidence showed that\nHenry Lee McCollum did not commit the rape and murder\nfor which he had been sentenced to death. Katz & Eck­\nholm, DNA Evidence Clears Two Men in 1983 Murder,\nN. Y. Times, Sept. 3, 2014, p. A1. Last Term, this Court\nordered that Anthony Ray Hinton, who had been convicted\nof murder, receive further hearings in state court; he was\nexonerated earlier this year because the forensic evidence\nused against him was flawed. Hinton v. Alabama, 571\nU. S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Blinder, Alabama Man on\nDeath Row for Three Decades Is Freed as State’s Case\nErodes, N. Y. Times, Apr. 4, 2014, p. A11. And when\nGlenn Ford, also convicted of murder, was exonerated, the\nprosecutor admitted that even “[a]t the time this case was\ntried there was evidence that would have cleared Glenn\nFord.” Stroud, Lead Prosecutor Apologizes for Role in\nSending Man to Death Row, Shreveport Times, Mar. 27,\n2015. All three of these men spent 30 years on death row\nbefore being exonerated. I return to these examples infra.\n   Furthermore, exonerations occur far more frequently\nwhere capital convictions, rather than ordinary criminal\nconvictions, are at issue. Researchers have calculated that\ncourts (or State Governors) are 130 times more likely to\nexonerate a defendant where a death sentence is at issue.\nThey are nine times more likely to exonerate where a\ncapital murder, rather than a noncapital murder, is at\nissue. Exonerations 2012 Report 15–16, and nn. 24–26.\n   Why is that so? To some degree, it must be because the\nlaw that governs capital cases is more complex. To some\ndegree, it must reflect the fact that courts scrutinize capi­\ntal cases more closely. But, to some degree, it likely also\n\f6                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreflects a greater likelihood of an initial wrongful convic­\ntion. How could that be so? In the view of researchers\nwho have conducted these studies, it could be so because\nthe crimes at issue in capital cases are typically horren­\ndous murders, and thus accompanied by intense community\npressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a\nconviction. This pressure creates a greater likelihood of\nconvicting the wrong person. See Gross, Jacoby, Mathe-\nson, Montgomery, & Patil, Exonerations in the United\nStates 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. & C. 523, 531–\n533 (2005); Gross & O’Brien, Frequency and Predictors of\nFalse Conviction: Why We Know So Little, and New Data\non Capital Cases, 5 J. Empirical L. Studies 927, 956–957\n(2008) (noting that, in comparing those who were exoner­\nated from death row to other capital defendants who were\nnot so exonerated, the initial police investigations tended\nto be shorter for those exonerated); see also B. Garrett,\nConvicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go\nWrong (2011) (discussing other common causes of wrong­\nful convictions generally including false confessions, mis­\ntaken eyewitness testimony, untruthful jailhouse inform­\nants, and ineffective defense counsel).\n   In the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, for example,\nwho (as noted earlier) was executed despite likely inno­\ncence, the State Bar of Texas recently filed formal miscon­\nduct charges against the lead prosecutor for his actions—\nactions that may have contributed to Willingham’s convic­\ntion. Possley, Prosecutor Accused of Misconduct in Death\nPenalty Case, Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2015, p. A3. And\nin Glenn Ford’s case, the prosecutor admitted that he was\npartly responsible for Ford’s wrongful conviction, issuing a\npublic apology to Ford and explaining that, at the time of\nFord’s conviction, he was “not as interested in justice as\n[he] was in winning.” Stroud, supra.\n   Other factors may also play a role. One is the practice\nof death-qualification; no one can serve on a capital jury\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

See\nRozelle, The Principled Executioner: Capital Juries’ Bias\nand the Benefits of True Bifurcation, 38 Ariz. S. L. J. 769,\n772–793, 807 (2006) (summarizing research and conclud­\ning that “[f]or over fifty years, empirical investigation has\ndemonstrated that death qualification skews juries toward\nguilt and death”); Note, Mandatory Voir Dire Questions in\nCapital Cases: A Potential Solution to the Biases of Death\nQualification, 10 Roger Williams Univ. L. Rev. 211, 214–\n223 (2004) (similar).\n   Another is the more general problem of flawed forensic\ntestimony. See Garrett, supra, at 7. The Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI), for example, recently found that\nflawed microscopic hair analysis was used in 33 of 35\ncapital cases under review; 9 of the 33 had already been\nexecuted. FBI, National Press Releases, FBI Testimony\non Microscopic Hair Analysis Contained Errors in at Least\n90 Percent of Cases in Ongoing Review, Apr. 20, 2015.\nSee also Hsu, FBI Admits Errors at Trials: False Matches\non Crime-Scene Hair, Washington Post, Apr. 19, 2015,\np. A1 (in the District of Columbia, which does not have the\ndeath penalty, five of seven defendants in cases with\nflawed hair analysis testimony were eventually exonerated).\n   In light of these and other factors, researchers estimate\nthat about 4% of those sentenced to death are actually\ninnocent. See Gross, O’Brien, Hu, & Kennedy, Rate of\nFalse Conviction of Criminal Defendants Who Are Sen­\ntenced to Death, 111 Proceeding of the National Academy\nof Sciences 7230 (2014) (full-scale study of all death sen­\ntences from 1973 through 2004 estimating that 4.1% of\nthose sentenced to death are actually innocent); Risinger,\nInnocents Convicted: An Empirically Justified Factual\nWrongful Conviction Rate, 97 J. Crim.

GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Finally, if we expand our definition of “exoneration”\n(which we limited to errors suggesting the defendant was\nactually innocent) and thereby also categorize as “errone­\nous” instances in which courts failed to follow legally\nrequired procedures, the numbers soar. Between 1973\nand 1995, courts identified prejudicial errors in 68% of the\ncapital cases before them. Gelman, Liebman, West, &\nKiss, A Broken System: The Persistent Patterns of Rever­\nsals of Death Sentences in the United States, 1 J. Empiri­\ncal L. Studies 209, 217 (2004). State courts on direct and\npostconviction review overturned 47% of the sentences\nthey reviewed. Id., at 232. Federal courts, reviewing\ncapital cases in habeas corpus proceedings, found error in\n40% of those cases. Ibid.\n  This research and these figures are likely controversial.\nFull briefing would allow us to scrutinize them with more\ncare. But, at a minimum, they suggest a serious problem\nof reliability. They suggest that there are too many in­\nstances in which courts sentence defendants to death\nwithout complying with the necessary procedures; and\nthey suggest that, in a significant number of cases, the\ndeath sentence is imposed on a person who did not commit\nthe crime. See Earley, A Pink Cadillac, An IQ of 63, and A\nFourteen-Year-Old from South Carolina: Why I Can No\nLonger Support the Death Penalty, 49 U. Rich. L.

A recent study, for example, examined all\ndeath penalty sentences imposed between 1973 and 2007\nin Connecticut, a State that abolished the death penalty in\n2012. Donohue, An Empirical Evaluation of the Connecti­\ncut Death Penalty System Since 1973: Are There Unlawful\nRacial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities? 11 J. Empiri­\ncal Legal Studies 637 (2014). The study reviewed treat­\nment of all homicide defendants. It found 205 instances in\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Courts imposed a death\nsentence in 12 of these 205 cases, of which 9 were sus­\ntained on appeal. Id., at 641. The study then measured\nthe “egregiousness” of the murderer’s conduct in those 9\ncases, developing a system of metrics designed to do so.\nId., at 643–645. It then compared the egregiousness of the\nconduct of the 9 defendants sentenced to death with the\negregiousness of the conduct of defendants in the remain­\ning 196 cases (those in which the defendant, though found\nguilty of a death-eligible offense, was ultimately not sen­\ntenced to death). Application of the studies’ metrics made\nclear that only 1 of those 9 defendants was indeed the\n“worst of the worst” (or was, at least, within the 15%\nconsidered most “egregious”). The remaining eight were\nnot. Their behavior was no worse than the behavior of at\nleast 33 and as many as 170 other defendants (out of a\ntotal pool of 205) who had not been sentenced to death.\nId., at 678–679.\n  Such studies indicate that the factors that most clearly\nought to affect application of the death penalty—namely,\ncomparative egregiousness of the crime—often do not.\nOther studies show that circumstances that ought not to\naffect application of the death penalty, such as race, gen­\nder, or geography, often do.\n  Numerous studies, for example, have concluded that\nindividuals accused of murdering white victims, as op­\nposed to black or other minority victims, are more likely to\nreceive the death penalty. See GAO, Report to the Senate\nand House Committees on the Judiciary: Death Penalty\nSentencing 5 (GAO/GGD–90–57, 1990) (82% of the 28\nstudies conducted between 1972 and 1990 found that race\nof victim influences capital murder charge or death sen­\ntence, a “finding . . . remarkably consistent across data\nsets, states, data collection methods, and analytic tech­\nniques”); Shatz & Dalton, Challenging the Death Penalty\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v.

Rev. 1227, 1245–1251 (2013)\n(same conclusion drawn from 20 plus studies conducted\nbetween 1990 and 2013).\n   Fewer, but still many, studies have found that the gen­\nder of the defendant or the gender of the victim makes a\nnot-otherwise-warranted difference. Id., at 1251–1253\n(citing many studies).\n   Geography also plays an important role in determining\nwho is sentenced to death. See id., at 1253–1256. And\nthat is not simply because some States permit the death\npenalty while others do not. Rather within a death pen­\nalty State, the imposition of the death penalty heavily de-\npends on the county in which a defendant is tried. Smith,\nThe Geography of the Death Penalty and its Ramifica­\ntions, 92 B. U. L. Rev. 227, 231–232 (2012) (hereinafter\nSmith); see also Donohue, supra, at 673 (“[T]he single\nmost important influence from 1973–2007 explaining\nwhether a death-eligible defendant [in Connecticut] would\nbe sentenced to death was whether the crime occurred in\nWaterbury [County]”). Between 2004 and 2009, for exam­\nple, just 29 counties (fewer than 1% of counties in the\ncountry) accounted for approximately half of all death\nsentences imposed nationwide. Smith 233. And in 2012,\njust 59 counties (fewer than 2% of counties in the country)\naccounted for all death sentences imposed nationwide.\nDPIC, The 2% Death Penalty: How A Minority of Counties\nProduce Most Death Cases At Enormous Costs to All 9\n(Oct. 2013).\n   What accounts for this county-by-county disparity?\nSome studies indicate that the disparity reflects the deci­\nsionmaking authority, the legal discretion, and ultimately\nthe power of the local prosecutor. See, e.g., Goelzhauser,\nProsecutorial Discretion Under Resource Constraints:\nBudget Allocations and Local Death-Charging Decisions,\n96 Judicature 161, 162–163 (2013); Barnes, Sloss, &\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Colo. L. Rev. 1069 (2013) (Colo-\nrado); Shatz & Dalton, supra, at 1260–1261 (Alameda\nCounty).\n   Others suggest that the availability of resources for\ndefense counsel (or the lack thereof) helps explain geo­\ngraphical differences. See, e.g., Smith 258–265 (counties\nwith higher death-sentencing rates tend to have weaker\npublic defense programs); Liebman & Clarke, Minority\nPractice, Majority’s Burden: The Death Penalty Today, 9\nOhio S. J. Crim. L. 255, 274 (2011) (hereinafter Liebman\n& Clarke) (similar); see generally Bright, Counsel for the\nPoor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime but for\nthe Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L. J. 1835 (1994).\n   Still others indicate that the racial composition of and\ndistribution within a county plays an important role. See,\ne.g., Levinson, Smith, & Young, Devaluing Death: An\nEmpirical Study of Implicit Racial Bias on Jury-Eligible\nCitizens in Six Death Penalty States, 89 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n513, 533–536 (2014) (summarizing research on this point);\nsee also Shatz & Dalton, supra, at 1275 (describing re­\nsearch finding that death-sentencing rates were lowest in\ncounties with the highest nonwhite population); cf. Cohen\n& Smith, The Racial Geography of the Federal Death\nPenalty, 85 Wash. L. Rev. 425 (2010) (arguing that the\nfederal death penalty is sought disproportionately where\nthe federal district, from which the jury will be drawn, has\na dramatic racial difference from the county in which the\nfederal crime occurred).\n   Finally, some studies suggest that political pressures,\nincluding pressures on judges who must stand for election,\n\f14                   GLOSSIP v.

Every murder is tragic, but unless we\nreturn to the mandatory death penalty struck down in\nWoodson, 428 U. S., at 304–305, the constitutionality of\ncapital punishment rests on its limited application to the\nworst of the worst, supra, at 9–10. And this extensive\nbody of evidence suggests that it is not so limited.\n   Four decades ago, the Court believed it possible to in­\nterpret the Eighth Amendment in ways that would signifi­\ncantly limit the arbitrary application of the death sen­\ntence. See Gregg, 428 U. S., at 195 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)

In\neach instance, the sentences compared were imposed in\nthe same State at about the same time.\n  The question raised by these examples (and the many\nmore I could give but do not), as well as by the research to\nwhich I have referred, is the same question Justice Stew­\nart, Justice Powell, and others raised over the course of\nseveral decades: The imposition and implementation of the\ndeath penalty seems capricious, random, indeed, arbi­\ntrary. From a defendant’s perspective, to receive that\nsentence, and certainly to find it implemented, is the\nequivalent of being struck by lightning. How then can we\nreconcile the death penalty with the demands of a Consti­\ntution that first and foremost insists upon a rule of law?\n                             III\n                  “Cruel”—Excessive Delays\n   The problems of reliability and unfairness almost inevi­\ntably lead to a third independent constitutional problem:\nexcessively long periods of time that individuals typically\nspend on death row, alive but under sentence of death.\nThat is to say, delay is in part a problem that the Consti­\ntution’s own demands create. Given the special need for\nreliability and fairness in death penalty cases, the Eighth\nAmendment does, and must, apply to the death penalty\n“with special force.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568. Those who\nface “that most severe sanction must have a fair oppor­\ntunity to show that the Constitution prohibits their execu­\ntion.” Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n22). At the same time, the Constitution insists that “every\n\f18                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsafeguard” be “observed” when “a defendant’s life is at\nstake.” Gregg, 428 U. S., at 187 (joint opinion of Stewart,\nPowell, and Stevens, JJ.); Furman, 408 U. S., at 306\n(Stewart, J., concurring) (death “differs from all other\nforms of criminal punishment, not in degree but in kind”);\nWoodson, supra, at 305 (plurality opinion) (“Death, in its\nfinality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100­\nyear prison term differs from one of only a year or two”).\n   These procedural necessities take time to implement.\nAnd, unless we abandon the procedural requirements that\nassure fairness and reliability, we are forced to confront\nthe problem of increasingly lengthy delays in capital cases.\nUltimately, though these legal causes may help to explain,\nthey do not mitigate the harms caused by delay itself.\n                             A\n   Consider first the statistics. In 2014, 35 individuals\nwere executed. Those executions occurred, on average,\nnearly 18 years after a court initially pronounced its\nsentence of death. DPIC, Execution List 2014, online\nat http: / / www.deathpenaltyinfo.org / execution - list-2014\n(showing an average delay of 17 years, 7 months). In some\ndeath penalty States, the average delay is longer. In\nan oral argument last year, for example, the State admit­\nted that the last 10 prisoners executed in Florida had\nspent an average of nearly 25 years on death row before\nexecution. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Hall v. Florida, O. T. 2013,\nNo. 12–10882, p. 46.\n   The length of the average delay has increased dramati­\ncally over the years. In 1960, the average delay between\nsentencing and execution was two years. See Aarons, Can\nInordinate Delay Between a Death Sentence and Execu­\ntion Constitute Cruel and Unusual Punishment? 29 Seton\nHall L. Rev. 147, 181 (1998). Ten years ago (in 2004) the\naverage delay was about 11 years. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), T. Snell, Capital Pun­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

By last year the\naverage had risen to about 18 years. DPIC, Execution List\n2014, supra. Nearly half of the 3,000 inmates now on\ndeath row have been there for more than 15 years. And,\nat present execution rates, it would take more than 75\nyears to carry out those 3,000 death sentences; thus, the\naverage person on death row would spend an additional\n37.5 years there before being executed. BJS 2013 Stats, at\n14, 18 (Tables 11 and 15).\n  I cannot find any reasons to believe the trend will soon\nbe reversed.\n                             B\n  These lengthy delays create two special constitutional\ndifficulties.

In 1890, this Court recognized\nthat, “when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is\nconfined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the\nsentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can\nbe subjected during that time is the uncertainty during\nthe whole of it.” Medley, supra, at 172. The Court was\nthere describing a delay of a mere four weeks. In the past\ncentury and a quarter, little has changed in this respect—\nexcept for duration. Today we must describe delays meas­\nured, not in weeks, but in decades. Supra, at 18–19.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Capi­\n\f24                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntal punishment by definition does not rehabilitate. It\ndoes, of course, incapacitate the offender. But the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates. See Ring\nv. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (2002) (BREYER, J., concur­\nring in judgment).\n   Thus, as the Court has recognized, the death penalty’s\npenological rationale in fact rests almost exclusively upon\na belief in its tendency to deter and upon its ability to\nsatisfy a community’s interest in retribution. See, e.g.,\nGregg, 428 U. S., at 183 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,\nand Stevens, JJ.). Many studies have examined the death\npenalty’s deterrent effect; some have found such an effect,\nwhereas others have found a lack of evidence that it deters\ncrime. Compare ante, at 5 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (collect­\ning studies finding deterrent effect), with e.g., Sorensen,\nWrinkle, Brewer, & Marquart, Capital Punishment and\nDeterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder\nin Texas, 45 Crime & Delinquency 481 (1999) (no evidence\nof a deterrent effect); Bonner & Fessenden, Absence of\nExecutions: A Special Report, States With No Death Pen­\nalty Share Lower Homicide Rates, N.

See Ring, supra, at 615 (one\nmight believe the studies “inconclusive”). But suppose\nthat we add to these studies the fact that, today, very few\nof those sentenced to death are actually executed, and that\neven those executions occur, on average, after nearly two\ndecades on death row. DPIC, Execution List 2014, supra.\nThen, does it still seem likely that the death penalty has a\nsignificant deterrent effect?\n   Consider, for example, what actually happened to the\n183 inmates sentenced to death in 1978. As of 2013 (35\nyears later), 38 (or 21% of them) had been executed; 132\n(or 72%) had had their convictions or sentences overturned\nor commuted; and 7 (or 4%) had died of other (likely natu­\nral) causes. Six (or 3%) remained on death row. BJS 2013\nStats, at 19 (Table 16).\n   The example illustrates a general trend. Of the 8,466\ninmates under a death sentence at some point between\n1973 and 2013, 16% were executed, 42% had their convic­\ntions or sentences overturned or commuted, and 6% died\nby other causes; the remainder (35%) are still on death\nrow. Id., at 20 (Table 17); see also Baumgartner & Die­\ntrich, Most Death Penalty Sentences Are Overturned:\nHere’s Why That Matters, Washington Post Blog, Monkey\nCage, Mar. 17, 2015 (similar).\n\f26                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Thus an offender who is sentenced to death is two or\nthree times more likely to find his sentence overturned or\ncommuted than to be executed; and he has a good chance\nof dying from natural causes before any execution (or\nexoneration) can take place. In a word, executions are\nrare. And an individual contemplating a crime but evalu­\nating the potential punishment would know that, in any\nevent, he faces a potential sentence of life without parole.\n   These facts, when recurring, must have some offsetting\neffect on a potential perpetrator’s fear of a death penalty.\nAnd, even if that effect is no more than slight, it makes it\ndifficult to believe (given the studies of deterrence cited\nearlier) that such a rare event significantly deters horren­\ndous crimes. See Furman, 408 U. S., at 311–312 (White,\nJ., concurring) (It cannot “be said with confidence that\nsociety’s need for specific deterrence justifies death for so\nfew when for so many in like circumstances life imprison­\nment or shorter prison terms are judged sufficient”).\n   But what about retribution? Retribution is a valid\npenological goal. I recognize that surviving relatives of\nvictims of a horrendous crime, or perhaps the community\nitself, may find vindication in an execution. And a com­\nmunity that favors the death penalty has an understand-\nable interest in representing their voices. But see A. Sarat,\nMercy on Trial: What It Means To Stop an Execution 130\n(2005) (Illinois Governor George Ryan explained his deci­\nsion to commute all death sentences on the ground that it\nwas “cruel and unusual” for “family members to go\nthrough this . . . legal limbo for [20] years”).\n   The relevant question here, however, is whether a\n“community’s sense of retribution” can often find vindica­\ntion in “a death that comes,” if at all, “only several decades\nafter the crime was committed.” Valle v. Florida, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of\nstay) (slip op., at 3). By then the community is a different\ngroup of people. The offenders and the victims’ families\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave grown far older. Feelings of outrage may have sub­\nsided. The offender may have found himself a changed\nhuman being. And sometimes repentance and even for­\ngiveness can restore meaning to lives once ruined. At the\nsame time, the community and victims’ families will know\nthat, even without a further death, the offender will serve\ndecades in prison under a sentence of life without parole.\n  I recognize, of course, that this may not always be the\ncase, and that sometimes the community believes that an\nexecution could provide closure. Nevertheless, the delays\nand low probability of execution must play some role in\nany calculation that leads a community to insist on death\nas retribution. As I have already suggested, they may well\nattenuate the community’s interest in retribution to the\npoint where it cannot by itself amount to a significant\njustification for the death penalty. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). In any event, I believe that whatever interest in retri­\nbution might be served by the death penalty as currently\nadministered, that interest can be served almost as well\nby a sentence of life in prison without parole (a sentence\nthat every State now permits, see ACLU, A Living Death:\nLife Without Parole for Nonviolent Offenses 11, and n. 10\n(2013)).\n  Finally, the fact of lengthy delays undermines any effort\nto justify the death penalty in terms of its prevalence\nwhen the Founders wrote the Eighth Amendment. When\nthe Founders wrote the Constitution, there were no 20- or\n30-year delays. Execution took place soon after sentenc­\ning. See P. Mackey, Hanging in the Balance: The Anti-\nCapital Punishment Movement in New York State, 1776–\n1861, p. 17 (1982); T. Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning\nCrimes and Punishments (1779), reprinted in The Com­\nplete Jefferson 90, 95 (S. Padover ed. 1943); 2 Papers of\nJohn Marshall 207–209 (C. Cullen & H.

And this Court has said that, if the\ndeath penalty does not fulfill the goals of deterrence or\nretribution, “it is nothing more than the purposeless and\nneedless imposition of pain and suffering and hence an\nunconstitutional punishment.” Atkins, 536 U.

S., at 1115 (statement of Stevens, J., respect­\ning denial of certiorari) (similar).\n   Indeed, Justice Lewis Powell (who provided a crucial\nvote in Gregg) came to much the same conclusion, albeit\nafter his retirement from this Court. Justice Powell had\ncome to the Court convinced that the Federal Constitution\ndid not outlaw the death penalty but rather left the matter\nup to individual States to determine. Furman, supra, at\n431–432 (Powell, J., dissenting); see also J. Jeffries, Jus­\ntice Lewis F.

Justice\nPowell, according to his official biographer, ultimately\nconcluded that capital punishment:\n    “ ‘serves no useful purpose.’ The United States was\n    ‘unique among the industrialized nations of the West\n    in maintaining the death penalty,’ and it was enforced\n    so rarely that it could not deter. More important, the\n    haggling and delay and seemingly endless litigation in\n    every capital case brought the law itself into disre­\n    pute.” Jeffries, supra, at 452.\nIn short, the problem of excessive delays led Justice Pow­\nell, at least in part, to conclude that the death penalty was\nunconstitutional.\n   As I have said, today delays are much worse. When\nChief Justice Rehnquist appointed Justice Powell to the\nCommittee, the average delay between sentencing and\nexecution was 7 years and 11 months, compared with 17\nyears and 7 months today. Compare BJS, L. Greenfeld,\nCapital Punishment, 1990, p. 11 (Table 12) (Sept. 1991)\nwith supra, at 18–19.\n                             C\n  One might ask, why can Congress or the States not deal\ndirectly with the delay problem? Why can they not take\nsteps to shorten the time between sentence and execution,\nand thereby mitigate the problems just raised? The an­\nswer is that shortening delay is much more difficult than\none might think. And that is in part because efforts to do\nso risk causing procedural harms that also undermine the\n\f30                   GLOSSIP v.

Recall the case of Henry\nLee McCollum, whom DNA evidence exonerated 30 years\nafter his conviction. Katz & Eckholm, N. Y. Times, at A1.\nIf McCollum had been executed earlier, he would not have\nlived to see the day when DNA evidence exonerated him\nand implicated another man; that man is already serving\na life sentence for a rape and murder that he committed\njust a few weeks after the murder McCollum was convicted\nof.

And yet a full 20 years after the Court denied\nreview, McCollum was exonerated by DNA evidence.\nThere are a significant number of similar cases, some of\nwhich I have discussed earlier.

See Part I, supra.

Or should we get rid of\nthe criminal protections that all criminal defendants\nreceive—for instance, that defendants claiming violation\nof constitutional guarantees (say “due process of law”) may\nseek a writ of habeas corpus in federal courts?

My answer to\nthese questions is “surely not.” But see ante, at 5–7\n(SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   One might, of course, argue that courts, particularly\nfederal courts providing additional layers of review, apply\nthese and other requirements too strictly, and that causes\ndelay. But, it is difficult for judges, as it would be difficult\nfor anyone, not to apply legal requirements punctiliously\nwhen the consequence of failing to do so may well be\ndeath, particularly the death of an innocent person.

(“Judicial process\ntakes time, but the error rate in capital cases illustrates\nits necessity”).\n   Moreover, review by courts at every level helps to en­\nsure reliability; if this Court had not ordered that Anthony\nRay Hinton receive further hearings in state court, see\nHinton v. Alabama, 571 U. S. ___, he may well have been\nexecuted rather than exonerated. In my own view, our\nlegal system’s complexity, our federal system with its\nseparate state and federal courts, our constitutional guar­\nantees, our commitment to fair procedure, and, above all,\na special need for reliability and fairness in capital cases,\ncombine to make significant procedural “reform” unlikely\nin practice to reduce delays to an acceptable level.\n   And that fact creates a dilemma: A death penalty sys­\ntem that seeks procedural fairness and reliability brings\nwith it delays that severely aggravate the cruelty of capi­\ntal punishment and significantly undermine the rationale\nfor imposing a sentence of death in the first place. See\nKnight, 528 U. S., at 998 (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (one of the primary causes of the delay\nis the States’ “failure to apply constitutionally sufficient\nprocedures at the time of initial [conviction or] sentenc­\ning”). But a death penalty system that minimizes delays\nwould undermine the legal system’s efforts to secure relia­\nbility and procedural fairness.\n   In this world, or at least in this Nation, we can have a\ndeath penalty that at least arguably serves legitimate\npenological purposes or we can have a procedural system\nthat at least arguably seeks reliability and fairness in the\ndeath penalty’s application. We cannot have both. And\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Last year, in 2014, only seven States\ncarried out an execution. Perhaps more importantly, in\nthe last two decades, the imposition and implementation\nof the death penalty have increasingly become unusual. I\ncan illustrate the significant decline in the use of the\ndeath penalty in several ways.\n   An appropriate starting point concerns the trajectory of\nthe number of annual death sentences nationwide, from\nthe 1970’s to present day. In 1977—just after the Su­\npreme Court made clear that, by modifying their legisla­\ntion, States could reinstate the death penalty—137 people\nwere sentenced to death. BJS 2013 Stats, at 19 (Table 16).\nMany States having revised their death penalty laws to\nmeet Furman’s requirements, the number of death sen­\ntences then increased. Between 1986 and 1999, 286 per­\nsons on average were sentenced to death each year. BJS\n2013 Stats, at 14, 19 (Tables 11 and 16). But, approxi­\nmately 15 years ago, the numbers began to decline, and\nthey have declined rapidly ever since. See Appendix A,\ninfra (showing sentences from 1977–2014). In 1999, 279\n\f34                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npersons were sentenced to death. BJS 2013 Stats, at 19\n(Table 16). Last year, just 73 persons were sentenced to\ndeath. DPIC, The Death Penalty in 2014: Year End Re­\nport 1 (2015).\n  That trend, a significant decline in the last 15 years,\nalso holds true with respect to the number of annual\nexecutions. See Appendix B, infra (showing executions\nfrom 1977–2014). In 1999, 98 people were executed. BJS,\nData Collection: National Prisoner Statistics Program\n(BJS Prisoner Statistics) (available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Last year, that number was only 35. DPIC, The\nDeath Penalty in 2014, supra, at 1.\n  Next, one can consider state-level data. Often when\ndeciding whether a punishment practice is, constitutionally\nspeaking, “unusual,” this Court has looked to the num-\nber of States engaging in that practice. Atkins, 536 U. S.,\nat 313–316; Roper, supra, at 564–566. In this respect, the\nnumber of active death penalty States has fallen dramati­\ncally. In 1972, when the Court decided Furman, the death\npenalty was lawful in 41 States. Nine States had abol­\nished it. E. Mandery, A Wild Justice: The Death and\nResurrection of Capital Punishment in America 145\n(2013). As of today, 19 States have abolished the death\npenalty (along with the District of Columbia), although\nsome did so prospectively only. See DPIC, States With\nand Without the Death Penalty, online at http://www.\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty. In\n11 other States that maintain the death penalty on the\nbooks, no execution has taken place for more than eight\nyears: Arkansas (last execution 2005); California (2006);\nColorado (1997); Kansas (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); Montana (2006); Nevada\n(2006); New Hampshire (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); North Carolina (2006);\nOregon (1997); Pennsylvania (1999); and Wyoming (1992).\nDPIC, Executions by State and Year, online at http://www.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Of the 20 States that have con­\nducted at least one execution in the past eight years, 9\nhave conducted fewer than five in that time, making an\nexecution in those States a fairly rare event. BJS Prisoner\nStatistics (Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington).            That\nleaves 11 States in which it is fair to say that capital\npunishment is not “unusual.” And just three of those\nStates (Texas, Missouri, and Florida) accounted for 80% of\nthe executions nationwide (28 of the 35) in 2014. See\nDPIC, Number of Executions by State and Region Since\n1976, online at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/number­\n\nexecutions-state-and-region-1976. Indeed, last year, only\nseven States conducted an execution. DPIC, Executions\nby State and Year, supra; DPIC, Death Sentences in the\nUnited States From 1977 by State and by Year, online at\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-sentences-united­\nstates-1977-2008. In other words, in 43 States, no one was\nexecuted.\n   In terms of population, if we ask how many Americans\nlive in a State that at least occasionally carries out an\nexecution (at least one within the prior three years), the\nanswer two decades ago was 60% or 70%. Today, that\nnumber is 33%. See Appendix C, infra.\n   At the same time, use of the death penalty has become\nincreasingly concentrated geographically.       County-by­\ncounty figures are relevant, for decisions to impose the\ndeath penalty typically take place at a county level. See\nsupra, at 12–13. County-level sentencing figures show\nthat, between 1973 and 1997, 66 of America’s 3,143 coun­\nties accounted for approximately 50% of all death sentences\nimposed. Liebman & Clarke 264–265; cf. id., at 266.\n(counties with 10% of the Nation’s population imposed\n\f36                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n43% of its death sentences). By the early 2000’s, the death\npenalty was only actively practiced in a very small number\nof counties: between 2004 and 2009, only 35 counties\nimposed 5 or more death sentences, i.e., approximately one\nper year. See Appendix D, infra (such counties colored in\nred) (citing Ford, The Death Penalty’s Last Stand, The\nAtlantic, Apr. 21, 2015). And more recent data show that\nthe practice has diminished yet further: between 2010 and\n2015 (as of June 22), only 15 counties imposed five or more\ndeath sentences. See Appendix E, infra. In short, the\nnumber of active death penalty counties is small and\ngetting smaller. And the overall statistics on county-level\nexecutions bear this out. Between 1976 and 2007, there\nwere no executions in 86% of America’s counties. Liebman\n& Clarke 265–266, and n. 47; cf. ibid. (counties with less\nthan 5% of the Nation’s population carried out over half of\nits executions from 1976–2007).\n   In sum, if we look to States, in more than 60% there is\neffectively no death penalty, in an additional 18% an\nexecution is rare and unusual, and 6%, i.e., three States,\naccount for 80% of all executions. If we look to population,\nabout 66% of the Nation lives in a State that has not\ncarried out an execution in the last three years. And if we\nlook to counties, in 86% there is effectively no death pen-\nalty. It seems fair to say that it is now unusual to find\ncapital punishment in the United States, at least when we\nconsider the Nation as a whole. See Furman, 408 U. S., at\n311 (1972) (White, J., concurring) (executions could be so\ninfrequently carried out that they “would cease to be a\ncredible deterrent or measurably to contribute to any\nother end of punishment in the criminal justice system . . .\nwhen imposition of the penalty reaches a certain degree\nof infrequency, it would be very doubtful that any exist-\ning general need for retribution would be measurably\nsatisfied”).\n   Moreover, we have said that it “ ‘is not so much the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          37\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnumber of these States that is significant, but the con­\nsistency of the direction of change.’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at\n566 (quoting Atkins, supra, at 315) (finding significant\nthat five States had abandoned the death penalty for\njuveniles, four legislatively and one judicially, since the\nCourt’s decision in Stanford v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112326\"><a href=\"/opinion/112326/stanford-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1989)). Judged in that way, capital punishment has\nindeed become unusual. Seven States have abolished the\ndeath penalty in the last decade, including (quite recently)\nNebraska. DPIC, States With and Without the Death\nPenalty, supra. And several States have come within a\nsingle vote of eliminating the death penalty.

Eleven\nStates, as noted earlier, have not executed anyone in eight\nyears. Supra, at 34–35. And several States have formally\nstopped executing inmates. See Yardley, Oregon’s Gover­\nnor Says He Will Not Allow Executions, N. Y. Times, Nov.\n23, 2011, p.

In the\npast two decades, no State without a death penalty has\npassed legislation to reinstate the penalty. See Atkins,\nsupra, at 315–316; DPIC, States With and Without the\nDeath Penalty, supra. Indeed, even in many States most\nassociated with the death penalty, remarkable shifts have\n\f38                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noccurred. In Texas, the State that carries out the most\nexecutions, the number of executions fell from 40 in 2000\nto 10 in 2014, and the number of death sentences fell from\n48 in 1999 to 9 in 2013 (and 0 thus far in 2015).

Similarly\ndramatic declines are present in Virginia, Oklahoma,\nMissouri, and North Carolina. BJS 1999 Stats, at 6 (Table\n5); BJS 2013 Stats, at 19 (Table 16).\n  These circumstances perhaps reflect the fact that a\nmajority of Americans, when asked to choose between the\ndeath penalty and life in prison without parole, now\nchoose the latter.

Why should we not leave the\nmatter up to the people acting democratically through\nlegislatures? The Constitution foresees a country that will\nmake most important decisions democratically. Most\nnations that have abandoned the death penalty have done\nso through legislation, not judicial decision. And legisla­\ntors, unlike judges, are free to take account of matters\nsuch as monetary costs, which I do not claim are relevant\nhere. See, e.g., Berman, Nebraska Lawmakers Abolish the\nDeath Penalty, Narrowly Overriding Governor’s Veto,\nWashington Post Blog, Post Nation, May 27, 2015) (listing\n\f40                   GLOSSIP v.

They concern the infliction—\nindeed the unfair, cruel, and unusual infliction—of a\nserious punishment upon an individual. I recognize that\nin 1972 this Court, in a sense, turned to Congress and the\nstate legislatures in its search for standards that would\nincrease the fairness and reliability of imposing a death\npenalty. The legislatures responded. But, in the last four\ndecades, considerable evidence has accumulated that\nthose responses have not worked.\n   Thus we are left with a judicial responsibility. The\nEighth Amendment sets forth the relevant law, and we\nmust interpret that law. See Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 177 (1803); Hall, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19) (“That exercise of independent judgment is the Court’s\njudicial duty”).

The State plans to execute petitioners using\nthree drugs: midazolam, rocuronium bromide, and potas­\nsium chloride. The latter two drugs are intended to para­\nlyze the inmate and stop his heart. But they do so in a\ntorturous manner, causing burning, searing pain. It is\nthus critical that the first drug, midazolam, do what it is\nsupposed to do, which is to render and keep the inmate\nunconscious. Petitioners claim that midazolam cannot be\nexpected to perform that function, and they have presented\nample evidence showing that the State’s planned use of\nthis drug poses substantial, constitutionally intolerable\nrisks.\n   Nevertheless, the Court today turns aside petitioners’\nplea that they at least be allowed a stay of execution while\nthey seek to prove midazolam’s inadequacy. The Court\nachieves this result in two ways: first, by deferring to the\nDistrict Court’s decision to credit the scientifically unsup­\nported and implausible testimony of a single expert wit­\nness; and second, by faulting petitioners for failing to\nsatisfy the wholly novel requirement of proving the avail­\nability of an alternative means for their own executions.\n\f2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nOn both counts the Court errs. As a result, it leaves peti­\ntioners exposed to what may well be the chemical equiva­\nlent of being burned at the stake.\n                                I\n\n                               A\n\n   The Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits the inflic­\ntion of “cruel and unusual punishments.” Seven years ago,\nin Baze v. Rees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145817\"><a href=\"/opinion/145817/baze-v-rees/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008), the Court addressed\nthe application of this mandate to Kentucky’s lethal injec­\ntion protocol. At that time, Kentucky, like at least 29 of\nthe 35 other States with the death penalty, utilized a\nseries of three drugs to perform executions: (1) sodium\nthiopental, a “fast-acting barbiturate sedative that induces\na deep, comalike unconsciousness when given in the\namounts used for lethal injection”; (2) pancuronium bro­\nmide, “a paralytic agent that inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and . . . stops respiration”; and (3) potassium\nchloride, which “interferes with the electrical signals that\nstimulate the contractions of the heart, inducing cardiac\narrest.” Id., at 44 (plurality opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).\n   In Baze, it was undisputed that absent a “proper dose of\nsodium thiopental,” there would be a “substantial, consti­\ntutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the admin­\nistration of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injec­\ntion of potassium chloride.” Id., at 53. That is because, if\ngiven to a conscious inmate, pancuronium bromide would\nleave him or her asphyxiated and unable to demonstrate\n“any outward sign of distress,” while potassium chloride\nwould cause “excruciating pain.” Id., at 71 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). But the Baze petitioners conceded\nthat if administered as intended, Kentucky’s method of\nexecution would nevertheless “result in a humane death,”\nid., at 41 (plurality opinion), as the “proper administra­\ntion” of sodium thiopental “eliminates any meaningful risk\nthat a prisoner would experience pain from the subse­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Based on that premise, the Court ultimately\nrejected the challenge to Kentucky’s protocol, with the\nplurality opinion concluding that the State’s procedures\nfor administering these three drugs ensured there was no\n“objectively intolerable risk” of severe pain. Id., at 61–62\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n                              B\n  For many years, Oklahoma performed executions using\nthe same three drugs at issue in Baze. After Baze was\ndecided, however, the primary producer of sodium thio­\npental refused to continue permitting the drug to be used\nin executions. Ante, at 4–5. Like a number of other\nStates, Oklahoma opted to substitute pentobarbital, an­\nother barbiturate, in its place. But in March 2014, shortly\nbefore two scheduled executions, Oklahoma found itself\nunable to secure this drug. App. 144.\n  The State rescheduled the executions for the following\nmonth to give it time to locate an alternative anesthetic.\nIn less than a week, a group of officials from the Okla-\nhoma Department of Corrections and the Attorney General’s\noffice selected midazolam to serve as a replacement for\npentobarbital. Id., at 145, 148–149.\n  Soon thereafter, Oklahoma used midazolam for the first\ntime in its execution of Clayton Lockett. That execution\ndid not go smoothly. Ten minutes after an intravenous\n(IV) line was set in Lockett’s groin area and 100 milli­\ngrams of midazolam were administered, an attending\nphysician declared Lockett unconscious. Id., at 392–393.\nWhen the paralytic and potassium chloride were adminis­\ntered, however, Lockett awoke. Ibid. Various witnesses\nreported that Lockett began to writhe against his re­\nstraints, saying, “[t]his s*** is f***ing with my mind,”\n“something is wrong,” and “[t]he drugs aren’t working.”\nId., at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). State offi­\n\f4                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncials ordered the blinds lowered, then halted the execu­\ntion.    Id., at 393, 395.       But 10 minutes later—\napproximately 40 minutes after the execution began—\nLockett was pronounced dead. Id., at 395.\n   The State stayed all future executions while it sought to\ndetermine what had gone wrong in Lockett’s. Five months\nlater, the State released an investigative report identify­\ning a flaw in the IV line as the principal difficulty: The IV\nhad failed to fully deliver the lethal drugs into Lockett’s\nveins. Id., at 398. An autopsy determined, however, that\nthe concentration of midazolam in Lockett’s blood was\nmore than sufficient to render an average person uncon­\nscious. Id., at 397, 405.\n   In response to this report, the State modified its lethal\ninjection protocol. The new protocol contains a number of\nprocedures designed to guarantee that members of the\nexecution team are able to insert the IV properly, and\ncharges them with ensuring that the inmate is uncon­\nscious. Id., at 57–66, 361–369. But the protocol continues\nto authorize the use of the same three-drug formula used\nto kill Lockett—though it does increase the intended dose\nof midazolam from 100 milligrams to 500 milligrams. Id.,\nat 61. The State has indicated that it plans to use this\ndrug combination in all upcoming executions, subject to\nonly an immaterial substitution of paralytic agents. Ante,\nat 7–8.\n                            C\n  In June 2014, inmates on Oklahoma’s death row filed a\n42 U. S. C. §1983 suit against respondent prison officials\nchallenging the constitutionality of Oklahoma’s method of\nexecution. After the State released its revised execution\nprotocol, the four inmates whose executions were most\nimminent—Charles Warner, along with petitioners Rich­\nard Glossip, John Grant, and Benjamin Cole—moved for a\npreliminary injunction. They contended, among other\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthings, that the State’s intended use of midazolam would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment because, unlike sodium\nthiopental or pentobarbital, the drug “is incapable of\nproducing a state of unawareness that will be reliably\nmaintained after either of the other two pain-producing\ndrugs . . . is injected.” Amended Complaint ¶101.\n   The District Court held a 3-day evidentiary hearing, at\nwhich petitioners relied principally on the testimony of\ntwo experts: Dr. David Lubarsky, an anesthesiologist, and\nDr. Larry Sasich, a doctor of pharmacy. The State, in\nturn, based its case on the testimony of Dr. Roswell Evans,\nalso a doctor of pharmacy.\n   To a great extent, the experts’ testimony overlapped.\nAll three experts agreed that midazolam is from a class of\nsedative drugs known as benzodiazepines (a class that\nincludes Valium and Xanax), and that it has no analge­\nsic—or pain-relieving—effects. App. 205 (Lubarsky), 260–\n261 (Sasich), 311 (Evans). They further agreed that while\nmidazolam can be used to render someone unconscious, it\nis not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\nfor use as, and is not in fact used as, a “sole drug to pro­\nduce and maintain anesthesia in surgical proceedings.”\nId., at 307, 327 (Evans); see id., at 171 (Lubarsky); id., at\n262 (Sasich). Finally, all three experts recognized that\nmidazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that\nthere is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug\ndoes not result in any greater effect.          Id., at 172\n(Lubarsky), 243 (Sasich), 331 (Evans).\n   The experts’ opinions diverged, however, on the crucial\nquestions of how this ceiling effect operates, and whether\nit will prevent midazolam from keeping a condemned\ninmate unconscious when the second and third lethal\ninjection drugs are administered. Dr. Lubarsky testified\nthat while benzodiazepines such as midazolam may, like\nbarbiturate drugs such as sodium thiopental and pento­\nbarbital, induce unconsciousness by inhibiting neuron\n\f6                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfunction, they do so in a materially different way. Id., at\n207. More specifically, Dr. Lubarsky explained that both\nbarbiturates and benzodiazepines initially cause sedation\nby facilitating the binding of a naturally occurring chemi­\ncal called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with GABA\nreceptors, which then impedes the flow of electrical im­\npulses through the neurons in the central nervous system.\nId., at 206. But at higher doses, barbiturates also act as a\nGABA substitute and mimic its neuron-suppressing ef­\nfects. Ibid. By contrast, benzodiazepines lack this mim­\nicking function, which means their effect is capped at a\nlower level of sedation. Ibid. Critically, according to Dr.\nLubarsky, this ceiling on midazolam’s sedative effect is\nreached before full anesthesia can be achieved. Ibid.\nThus, in his view, while “midazolam unconsciousness is\n. . . sufficient” for “minor procedure[s],” Tr. of Preliminary\nInjunction Hearing 132–133 (Tr.), it is incapable of keep­\ning someone “insensate and immobile in the face of [more]\nnoxious stimuli,” including the extreme pain and discom­\nfort associated with administration of the second and third\ndrugs in Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol, App. 218.\nDr. Sasich endorsed Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the\nceiling effect, and offered similar reasons for reaching the\nsame conclusion. See id., at 243, 248, 262.\n    In support of these assertions, both experts cited a\nvariety of evidence. Dr. Lubarsky emphasized, in particu­\nlar, Arizona’s 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, which had\nbeen conducted using midazolam and the drug hydromor­\nphone rather than the three-drug cocktail Oklahoma\nintends to employ.1 Id., at 176. Despite being adminis­\ntered 750 milligrams of midazolam, Wood had continued\nbreathing and moving for nearly two hours—which, ac­\n——————\n  1 Hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic similar to morphine or hero­\n\nin. See R. Stoelting & S. Hillier, Pharmacology & Physiology in Anes­\nthetic Practice 87–88 (4th ed. 2006) (Stoelting & Hillier).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Both\nexperts also cited various scientific articles and textbooks\nto support their conclusions. For instance, Dr. Lubarsky\nrelied on a study measuring the brain activity of rats that\nwere administered midazolam, which showed that the\ndrug’s impact significantly tailed off at higher doses. See\nHovinga et al., Pharmacokinetic-EEG Effect Relationship\nof Midazolam in Aging BN/BiRij Rats, 107 British J.\nPharmacology 171, 173, Fig. 2 (1992). He also pointed to a\npharmacology textbook that confirmed his description of\nhow benzodiazepines and barbiturates produce their\neffects, see Stoelting & Hillier 127–128, 140–144, and a\nsurvey article concluding that “[m]idazolam cannot be\nused alone . . . to maintain adequate anesthesia,” Reves,\nFragen, Vinik, & Greenblatt, Midazolam: Pharmacology\nand Uses, 62 Anesthesiology 310, 318 (1985) (Reves). For\nhis part, Dr. Sasich referred to a separate survey article,\nwhich similarly recognized and described the ceiling effect\nto which benzodiazepines are subject. See Saari, Uusi-\nOukari, Ahonen, & Olkkola, Enhancement of GABAergic\nActivity: Neuropharmacological Effects of Benzodiazepines\nand Therapeutic Use in Anesthesiology, 63 Pharamacolog­\nical Rev. 243, 244, 250 (2011) (Saari).\n  By contrast, Dr. Evans, the State’s expert, asserted that\na 500-milligram dose of midazolam would “render the\nperson unconscious and ‘insensate’ during the remainder\nof the [execution] procedure.” App. 294. He rested this\nconclusion on two interrelated propositions.\n  First, observing that a therapeutic dose of midazolam to\ntreat anxiety is less than 5 milligrams for a 70-kilogram\nadult, Dr. Evans emphasized that Oklahoma’s planned\nadministration of 500 milligrams of the drug was “at least\n100 times the normal therapeutic dose.” Ibid. While he\nacknowledged that “[t]here are no studies that have been\ndone . . . administering that much . . . midazolam . . . to\n\f8                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nanybody,” he noted that deaths had occurred in doses as\nlow as 0.04 to 0.07 milligrams per kilogram (2.8 to 4.9\nmilligrams for a 70-kilogram adult), and contended that a\n500-milligram dose would itself cause death within less\nthan an hour—a conclusion he characterized as “essentially\nan extrapolation from a toxic effect.” Id., at 327; see id.,\nat 308.\n   Second, in explaining how he reconciled his opinion with\nthe evidence of midazolam’s ceiling effect, Dr. Evans testi­\nfied that while “GABA receptors are found across the\nentire body,” midazolam’s ceiling effect is limited to the\n“spinal cord” and there is “no ceiling effect” at the “higher\nlevel of [the] brain.” Id., at 311–312. Consequently, in his\nview, “as you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a linear\neffect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact from\nhigher doses of the drug,” id., at 332, until eventually\n“you’re paralyzing the brain,” id., at 314. Dr. Evans also\nunderstood the chemical source of midazolam’s ceiling\neffect somewhat differently from petitioners’ experts.\nAlthough he agreed that midazolam produces its effect by\n“binding to [GABA] receptors,” id., at 293, he appeared to\nbelieve that midazolam produced sedation by “inhibiting\nGABA” from attaching to GABA receptors, not by promot­\ning GABA’s sedative effects, id., at 312. Thus, when asked\nabout Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the ceiling effect, Dr.\nEvans characterized the phenomenon as stemming from\n“the competitive nature of substances trying to attach to\nGABA receptors.” Id., at 313.\n   Dr. Evans cited no scholarly research in support of his\nopinions. Instead, he appeared to rely primarily on two\nsources: the Web site www.drugs.com, and a “Material\nSafety Data Sheet” produced by a midazolam manufacturer.\nSee id., at 303. Both simply contained general infor­\nmation that covered the experts’ areas of agreement.\n\f                   Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)              9\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                             D\n  The District Court denied petitioners’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction. It began by making a series of\nfactual findings regarding the characteristics of midazo­\nlam and its use in Oklahoma’s execution protocol. Most\nrelevant here, the District Court found that “[t]he proper\nadministration of 500 milligrams of midazolam . . . would\nmake it a virtual certainty that an individual will be at a\nsufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious\nstimuli which could occur from the application of the\nsecond and third drugs.” Id., at 77. Respecting petition­\ners’ contention that there is a “ceiling effect which pre­\nvents an increase in dosage from having a corresponding\nincremental effect on anesthetic depth,” the District Court\nconcluded:\n    “Dr. Evans testified persuasively . . . that whatever\n    the ceiling effect of midazolam may be with respect to\n    anesthesia, which takes effect at the spinal cord level,\n    there is no ceiling effect with respect to the ability of a\n    500 milligram dose of midazolam to effectively para­\n    lyze the brain, a phenomenon which is not anesthesia\n    but does have the effect of shutting down respiration\n    and eliminating the individual’s awareness of pain.”\n    Id., at 78.\n   Having made these findings, the District Court held\nthat petitioners had shown no likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their Eighth Amendment claim for two inde­\npendent reasons. First, it determined that petitioners had\n“failed to establish that proceeding with [their] execu­\ntion[s] . . . on the basis of the revised protocol presents . . .\n‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” Id., at 96. Sec­\nond, the District Court held that petitioners were unlikely\nto prevail because they had not identified any “ ‘known and\navailable alternative’ ” means by which they could be\nexecuted—a requirement it understood Baze to impose.\n\f10                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nId., at 97. The District Court concluded that the State\n“ha[d] affirmatively shown that sodium thiopental and\npentobarbital, the only alternatives to which the [petition­\ners] have even alluded, are not available to the [State].”\nId., at 98.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nWarner v. Gross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). It, like the District\nCourt, held that petitioners were unlikely to prevail on the\nmerits because they had failed to prove the existence of\n“ ‘known and available alternatives.’ ” Id., at 732. “In any\nevent,” the court continued, it was unable to conclude that\nthe District Court’s factual findings had been clearly\nerroneous, and thus petitioners had also “failed to estab­\nlish that the use of midazolam in their executions . . .\ncreates a demonstrated risk of severe pain.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners and Charles Warner filed a petition for\ncertiorari and an application to stay their executions. The\nCourt denied the stay application, and Charles Warner\nwas executed on January 15, 2015. See Warner v. Gross,\n574 U. S. ___ (2015) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari). The Court subsequently granted\ncertiorari and, at the request of the State, stayed petition­\ners’ pending executions.\n                             II\n  I begin with the second of the Court’s two holdings: that\nthe District Court properly found that petitioners did not\ndemonstrate a likelihood of showing that Oklahoma’s\nexecution protocol poses an unconstitutional risk of pain.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court sweeps aside sub­\nstantial evidence showing that, while midazolam may be\nable to induce unconsciousness, it cannot be utilized to\nmaintain unconsciousness in the face of agonizing stimuli.\nInstead, like the District Court, the Court finds comfort in\nDr. Evans’ wholly unsupported claims that 500 milligrams\nof midazolam will “paralyz[e] the brain.” In so holding,\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Unlike the Court, however, I would do so without\nabdicating our duty to examine critically the factual predi­\ncates for the District Court’s finding—namely, Dr. Evans’\ntestimony that midazolam has a “ceiling effect” only “at\nthe spinal cord level,” and that a “500 milligram dose of\nmidazolam” can therefore “effectively paralyze the brain.”\nId., at 78. To be sure, as the Court observes, such scien­\ntific testimony may at times lie at the boundaries of fed­\neral courts’ expertise. See ante, at 17–18. But just because\na purported expert says something does not make it so.\nEspecially when important constitutional rights are at\nstake, federal district courts must carefully evaluate the\npremises and evidence on which scientific conclusions are\nbased, and appellate courts must ensure that the courts\nbelow have in fact carefully considered all the evidence\npresented. Clear error exists “when although there is\nevidence to support” a finding, “the reviewing court on the\nentire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction\nthat a mistake has been committed.” United States v.\nUnited States Gypsum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104523\"><a href=\"/opinion/104523/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (1948).\nHere, given the numerous flaws in Dr. Evans’ testimony,\nthere can be little doubt that the District Court clearly\nerred in relying on it.\n   To begin, Dr. Evans identified no scientific literature to\nsupport his opinion regarding midazolam’s properties at\nhigher-than-normal doses. Apart from a Material Safety\nData Sheet that was relevant only insofar as it suggests\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat a low dose of midazolam may occasionally be toxic,\nsee ante, at 27—an issue I discuss further below—Dr.\nEvans’ testimony seems to have been based on the Web\nsite www.drugs.com. The Court may be right that “peti­\ntioners do not identify any incorrect statements from\ndrugs.com on which Dr. Evans relied.” Ante, at 27. But\nthat is because there were no statements from drugs.com\nthat supported the critically disputed aspects of Dr. Evans’\nopinion. If anything, the Web site supported petitioners’\ncontentions, as it expressly cautioned that midazolam\n“[s]hould not be used alone for maintenance of anesthe­\nsia,” App. H to Pet. for Cert. 6159, and contained no warn­\ning that an excessive dose of midazolam could “paralyze\nthe brain,” see id., at 6528–6529.\n   Most importantly, nothing from drugs.com—or, for that\nmatter, any other source in the record—corroborated Dr.\nEvans’ key testimony that midazolam’s ceiling effect is\nlimited to the spinal cord and does not pertain to the\nbrain. Indeed, the State appears to have disavowed Dr.\nEvans’ spinal-cord theory, refraining from even mention­\ning it in its brief despite the fact that the District Court\nexpressly relied on this testimony as the basis for finding\nthat larger doses of midazolam will have greater anesthetic\neffects. App. 78. The Court likewise assiduously avoids\ndefending this theory.\n   That is likely because this aspect of Dr. Evans’ testi-\nmony was not just unsupported, but was directly refuted by\nthe studies and articles cited by Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich.\nBoth of these experts relied on academic texts describing\nbenzodiazepines’ ceiling effect and explaining why it pre­\nvents these drugs from rendering a person completely\ninsensate. See Stoelting & Hillier 141, 144 (describing\nmidazolam’s ceiling effect and contrasting the drug with\nbarbiturates); Saari 244 (observing that “abolishment of\nperception of environmental stimuli cannot usually be\ngenerated”). One study further made clear that the ceiling\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                   13\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\neffect is apparent in the brain. See id., at 250.\n  These scientific sources also appear to demonstrate that\nDr. Evans’ spinal-cord theory—i.e., that midazolam’s\nceiling effect is limited to the spinal cord—was premised\non a basic misunderstanding of midazolam’s mechanism of\naction. I say “appear” not because the sources themselves\nare unclear about how midazolam operates: They plainly\nstate that midazolam functions by promoting GABA’s\ninhibitory effects on the central nervous system. See, e.g.,\nStoelting & Hillier 140. Instead, I use “appear” because\ndiscerning the rationale underlying Dr. Evans’ testimony\nis difficult. His spinal-cord theory might, however, be\nexplained at least in part by his apparent belief that rather\nthan promoting GABA’s inhibitory effects, midazolam\nproduces sedation by “compet[ing]” with GABA and thus\n“inhibit[ing]” GABA’s effect. App. 312–313.2 Regardless, I\nneed not delve too deeply into Dr. Evans’ alternative\nscientific reality. It suffices to say that to the extent that\nDr. Evans’ testimony was based on his understanding of\nthe source of midazolam’s pharmacological properties, that\nunderstanding was wrong.\n——————\n  2 The Court disputes this characterization of Dr. Evans’ testimony,\n\ninsisting that Dr. Evans accurately described midazolam’s properties in\nthe written report he submitted prior to the hearing below, and sug­\ngesting that petitioners’ experts would have “dispute[d] the accuracy” of\nthis explanation were it in fact wrong. Ante, at 25. But Dr. Evans’\nwritten report simply said midazolam “produces different levels of\ncentral nervous system (CNS) depression through binding to [GABA]\nreceptors.” App. 293. That much is true. Only after Drs. Sasich and\nLubarsky testified did Dr. Evans further claim that midazolam pro­\nduced CNS depression by binding to GABA receptors and thereby\npreventing GABA itself from binding to those receptors—which is where\nhe went wrong. The Court’s further observation that Dr. Lubarsky also\nused a variant on the word “inhibiting” in his testimony—in saying that\nGABA’s “ ‘inhibition of brain activity is accentuated by midazolam,’ ”\nante, at 25 (quoting App. 232)—is completely nonresponsive. “Inhibit­\ning” is a perfectly good word; the problem here is the manner in which\nDr. Evans used it in a sentence.\n\f14                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   These inconsistencies and inaccuracies go to the very\nheart of Dr. Evans’ expert opinion, as they were the key\ncomponents of his professed belief that one can extrapolate\nfrom what is known about midazolam’s effect at low doses\nto conclude that the drug would “paralyz[e] the brain” at\nOklahoma’s planned dose. Id., at 314. All three experts\nrecognized that there had been no scientific testing on the\nuse of this amount of midazolam in conjunction with these\nparticular lethal injection drugs. See ante, at 19; App. 176\n(Lubarsky), 243–244 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). For this rea­\nson, as the Court correctly observes, “extrapolation was\nreasonable.” Ante, at 20. But simply because extrapola­\ntion may be reasonable or even required does not mean\nthat every conceivable method of extrapolation can be\ncredited, or that all estimates stemming from purported\nextrapolation are worthy of belief. Dr. Evans’ view was\nthat because 40 milligrams of midazolam could be used to\ninduce unconsciousness, App. 294, and because more drug\nwill generally produce more effect, a significantly larger\ndose of 500 milligrams would not just induce unconscious­\nness but allow for its maintenance in the face of extremely\npainful stimuli, and ultimately even cause death itself. In\nhis words: “[A]s you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a\nlinear effect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact\nfrom higher doses of the drug.” Id., at 332. If, however,\nthere is a ceiling with respect to midazolam’s effect on the\nbrain—as petitioners’ experts established there is—then\nsuch simplistic logic is not viable. In this context, more is\nnot necessarily better, and Dr. Evans was plainly wrong to\npresume it would be.\n   If Dr. Evans had any other basis for the “extrapolation”\nthat led him to conclude 500 milligrams of midazolam\nwould “paralyz[e] the brain,” id., at 314, it was even fur­\nther divorced from scientific evidence and logic. Having\nemphasized that midazolam had been known to cause\napproximately 80 deaths, Dr. Evans asserted that his\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                    15\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nopinion regarding the efficacy of Oklahoma’s planned use\nof the drug represented “essentially an extrapolation from\na toxic effect.” Id., at 327 (emphasis added); see id., at\n308. Thus, Dr. Evans appeared to believe—and again, I\nsay “appeared” because his rationale is not clear—that\nbecause midazolam caused some deaths, it would neces­\nsarily cause complete unconsciousness and then death at\nespecially high doses. But Dr. Evans also thought, and\nDr. Lubarsky confirmed, that these midazolam fatalities\nhad occurred at very low doses—well below what any\nexpert said would produce unconsciousness. See id., at\n207, 308. These deaths thus seem to represent the rare,\nunfortunate side effects that one would expect to see with\nany drug at normal therapeutic doses; they provide no\nindication of the effect one would expect midazolam to\nhave on the brain at substantially higher doses. Deaths\noccur with almost any product. One might as well say\nthat because some people occasionally die from eating one\npeanut, one hundred peanuts would necessarily induce a\ncoma and death in anyone.3\n  In sum, then, Dr. Evans’ conclusions were entirely\nunsupported by any study or third-party source, contra­\ndicted by the extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners,\ninconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazo­\nlam’s properties, and apparently premised on basic logical\nerrors. Given these glaring flaws, the District Court’s\n——————\n  3 For all the reasons discussed in Part II–B, infra, and contrary to the\nCourt’s claim, see ante, at 20, n. 4, there are good reasons to doubt that\n500 milligrams of midazolam will, in light of the ceiling effect, inevita­\nbly kill someone. The closest the record comes to providing support for\nthis contention is the fleeting mention in the FDA-approved product\nlabel that one of the possible consequences of midazolam overdosage is\ncoma. See ante, at 21, n. 5. Moreover, even if this amount of the drug\ncould kill some people in “under an hour,” ante, at 20, n. 4, that would\nnot necessarily mean that the condemned would be insensate during\nthe approximately 10 minutes it takes for the paralytic and potassium\nchloride to do their work.\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v.

In other words, this is a\ncase in which the District Court clearly erred. See ibid.\n                               B\n   Setting aside the District Court’s erroneous factual\nfinding that 500 milligrams of midazolam will necessarily\n“paralyze the brain,” the question is whether the Court is\nnevertheless correct to hold that petitioners failed to\ndemonstrate that the use of midazolam poses an “objec­\ntively intolerable risk” of severe pain. See Baze, 553 U. S.,\nat 50 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). I would hold that they made this showing. That is\nbecause, in stark contrast to Dr. Evans, petitioners’ ex­\nperts were able to point to objective evidence indicating\nthat midazolam cannot serve as an effective anesthetic\nthat “render[s] a person insensate to pain caused by the\nsecond and third [lethal injection] drugs.” Ante, at 23.\n   As observed above, these experts cited multiple sources\nsupporting the existence of midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nThat evidence alone provides ample reason to doubt mid­\nazolam’s efficacy. Again, to prevail on their claim, peti­\ntioners need only establish an intolerable risk of pain, not\na certainty. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 50. Here, the State is\nattempting to use midazolam to produce an effect the drug\nhas never previously been demonstrated to produce, and\ndespite studies indicating that at some point increasing\nthe dose will not actually increase the drug’s effect. The\nState is thus proceeding in the face of a very real risk that\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U.

The\nCourt insists that petitioners failed to provide “probative\nevidence” as to whether “midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs\nbelow the level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at\nwhich the drug does not have the effect of rendering a\nperson insensate to pain.” Ante, at 23. It emphasizes that\nDr. Lubarsky was unable to say “at what dose the ceiling\neffect occurs,” and could only estimate that it was\n“ ‘[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams.’ ” Ante, at\n23 (quoting App. 225).\n    But the precise dose at which midazolam reaches its\nceiling effect is irrelevant if there is no dose at which the\ndrug can, in the Court’s words, render a person “insensate\nto pain.” Ante, at 23. On this critical point, Dr. Lubarsky\nwas quite clear.4 He explained that the drug “does not\nwork to produce” a “lack of consciousness as noxious stim­\nuli are applied,” and is “not sufficient to produce a surgical\nplane of anesthesia in human beings.” App. 204. He also\n——————\n  4 Dr. Sasich, as the Court emphasizes, was perhaps more hesitant to\nreach definitive conclusions, see ante, at 19–21, and n. 5, 23–24, but the\nstatements highlighted by the Court largely reflect his (truthful)\nobservations that no testing has been done at doses of 500 milligrams,\nand his inability to pinpoint the precise dose at which midazolam's\nceiling effect might be reached. Dr. Sasich did not, as the Court sug­\ngests, claim that midazolam’s ceiling effect would be reached only after\na person became fully insensate to pain. Ante, at 24. What Dr. Sasich\nactually said was: “As the dose increases, the benzodiazepines are\nexpected to produce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to\nstimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).” App. 243. In context, it is\nclear that Dr. Sasich was simply explaining that a drug like midazolam\ncan be used to induce unconsciousness—an issue that was and remains\nundisputed—not that it could render an inmate sufficiently unconscious\nto resist all noxious stimuli. Indeed, it was midazolam’s possible\ninability to serve the latter function that led Dr. Sasich to conclude that\n“it is not an appropriate drug to use when administering a paralytic\nfollowed by potassium chloride.” Id., at 248.\n\f18                       GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnoted that “[t]he drug would never be used and has never\nbeen used as a sole anesthetic to give anesthesia during a\nsurgery,” id., at 223, and asserted that “the drug was not\napproved by the FDA as a sole anesthetic because after\nthe use of fairly large doses that were sufficient to reach\nthe ceiling effect and produce induction of unconscious­\nness, the patients responded to the surgery,” id., at 219.\nThus, Dr. Lubarsky may not have been able to identify\nwhether this effect would be reached at 40, 50, or 60 milli­\ngrams or some higher threshold, but he could specify\nthat at no level would midazolam reliably keep an in-\nmate unconscious once the second and third drugs were\ndelivered.5\n   These assertions were amply supported by the evidence\nof the manner in which midazolam is and can be used. All\nthree experts agreed that midazolam is utilized as the sole\nsedative only in minor procedures. Dr. Evans, for exam­\nple, acknowledged that while midazolam may be used as\nthe sole drug in some procedures that are not “terribly\ninvasive,” even then “you would [generally] see it used in\ncombination with a narcotic.” Id., at 307. And though, as\nthe Court observes, Dr. Sasich believed midazolam could\nbe “used for medical procedures like colonoscopies and\ngastroscopies,” ante, at 21, he insisted that these proce­\ndures were not necessarily painful, and that it would be a\n——————\n  5 The Court claims that the District Court could have properly disre­\n\ngarded Dr. Lubarsky’s testimony because he asserted that a protocol\nwith sodium thiopental would “ ‘produce egregious harm and suffer­\ning.’ ” Ante, at 24, n. 6 (quoting App. 227). But Dr. Lubarsky did not\ntestify that, like midazolam, sodium thiopental would not render an\ninmate fully insensate even if properly administered; rather, he simply\nobserved that he had previously contended that protocols using that\ndrug were ineffective. See App. 227. He was presumably referring to\nan article he coauthored that found many condemned inmates were not\nbeing successfully delivered the dose of sodium thiopental necessary to\nfully anesthetize them.

Tr.\n369–370. Indeed, the record provides no reason to think\nthat these procedures cause excruciating pain remotely\ncomparable to that produced by the second and third\nlethal injection drugs Oklahoma intends to use.\n   As for more painful procedures, the consensus was also\nclear: Midazolam is not FDA-approved for, and is not used\nas, a sole drug to maintain unconsciousness. See App. 171\n(Lubarsky), 262 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). One might infer\nfrom the fact that midazolam is not used as the sole anes­\nthetic for more serious procedures that it cannot be used\nfor them. But drawing such an inference is unnecessary,\nas petitioners’ experts invoked sources expressly stating\nas much. In particular, Dr. Lubarsky pointed to a survey\narticle that cited four separate authorities and declared\nthat “[m]idazolam cannot be used alone . . . to maintain\nadequate anesthesia.” Reves 318; see also Stoelting &\nHillier 145 (explaining that midzolam is used for “induc­\ntion of anesthesia,” and that, “[i]n combination with other\ndrugs, [it] may be used for maintenance of anesthesia”\n(emphasis added)).\n   This evidence was alone sufficient, but if one wanted\nfurther support for these conclusions it was provided by\nthe Lockett and Wood executions. The procedural flaws\nthat marred the Lockett execution created the conditions\nfor an unintended (and grotesque) experiment on midazo­\nlam’s efficacy. Due to problems with the IV line, Lockett\nwas not fully paralyzed after the second and third drugs\nwere administered. He had, however, been administered\nmore than enough midazolam to “render an average per­\nson unconscious,” as the District Court found. App. 57.\nWhen Lockett awoke and began to writhe and speak, he\ndemonstrated the critical difference between midazolam’s\nability to render an inmate unconscious and its ability to\nmaintain the inmate in that state. The Court insists that\n\f20                       GLOSSIP v.

These\nreactions were, according to Dr. Lubarsky, inconsistent\nwith Wood being fully anesthetized, App. 177–178, and\nbelie the claim that a lesser dose of 500 milligrams would\nsomehow suffice. The Court attempts to distinguish the\nWood execution on the ground that the timing of Arizona’s\nadministration of midazolam was different. Ante, at 28.\nBut as Dr. Lubarsky testified, it did not “matter” whether\nin Wood’s execution the “midazolam was introduced all at\nonce or over . . . multiple doses,” because “[t]he drug has a\nsufficient half life that the effect is cumulative.” App. 220;\nsee also Saari 253 (midazolam’s “elimination half-life\nranges from 1.7 to 3.5 h[ours]”).6 Nor does the fact that\nWood’s dose of midazolam was paired with hydromor­\nphone rather than a paralytic and potassium chromide,\nsee ante, at 29, appear to have any relevance—other than\nthat the use of this analgesic drug may have meant that\nWood did not experience the same degree of searing pain\nthat an inmate executed under Oklahoma’s protocol may\nface.\n  By contrast, Florida’s use of this same three-drug proto­\ncol in 11 executions, see ante, at 28 (citing Brief for State\nof Florida as Amicus Curiae 1), tells us virtually nothing.\nAlthough these executions have featured no obvious mis­\nhaps, the key word is “obvious.” Because the protocol\n——————\n  6 The Court asserts that the State refuted these contentions, pointing\n\nto Dr. Evans’ testimony that 750 milligrams of the drug “might not\nhave the effect that was sought” if administered over an hour.

Even in these\nexecutions, moreover, there have been indications of the\ninmates’ possible awareness. See Brief for State of Ala­\nbama et al. as Amici Curiae 9–13 (describing the 11 Flor-\nida executions, and noting that some allegedly involved\nblinking and other movement after administration of the\nthree drugs).7\n   Finally, none of the State’s “safeguards” for administer­\ning these drugs would seem to mitigate the substantial\nrisk that midazolam will not work, as the Court contends.\nSee ante, at 21–22. Protections ensuring that officials\nhave properly secured a viable IV site will not enable\nmidazolam to have an effect that it is chemically incapable\nof having. Nor is there any indication that the State’s\nmonitoring of the inmate’s consciousness will be able to\nanticipate whether the inmate will remain unconscious\nwhile the second and third drugs are administered. No\none questions whether midazolam can induce uncon­\nsciousness. The problem, as Lockett’s execution vividly\nillustrates, is that an unconscious inmate may be awak­\nened by the pain and respiratory distress caused by ad­\nministration of the second and third drugs. At that point,\neven if it were possible to determine whether the inmate is\nconscious—dubious, given the use of a paralytic—it is\nalready too late.

A method of execu­\ntion that is intolerably painful—even to the point of being\nthe chemical equivalent of burning alive—will, the Court\nholds, be unconstitutional if, and only if, there is a “known\nand available alternative” method of execution. Ante, at\n15. It deems Baze to foreclose any argument to the con­\ntrary. Ante, at 14.\n   Baze held no such thing. In the first place, the Court\ncites only the plurality opinion in Baze as support for its\nknown-and-available-alternative requirement. See ibid.\nEven assuming that the Baze plurality set forth such a\nrequirement—which it did not—none of the Members of\nthe Court whose concurrences were necessary to sustain\nthe Baze Court’s judgment articulated a similar view. See\n553 U. S., at 71–77, 87 (Stevens, J., concurring in judg­\nment); id., at 94, 99–107 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­\nment); id., at 107–108, 113 (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment).

And as the Court observes,\nante, at 14, n. 2, the opinion of JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by\nJUSTICE SCALIA, took the broadest position with respect to\nthe degree of intent that state officials must have in\norder to have violated the Eighth Amendment, concluding\nthat only a method of execution deliberately designed\nto inflict pain, and not one simply designed with deliberate\nindifference to the risk of severe pain, would be un­\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

But this understanding of the Eighth\nAmendment’s intent requirement is unrelated to, and thus\nnot any broader or narrower than, the requirement the\nCourt now divines from Baze. Because the position that a\nplaintiff challenging a method of execution under the\nEighth Amendment must prove the availability of an\nalternative means of execution did not “represent the\nviews of a majority of the Court,” it was not the holding of\nthe Baze Court. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111860\"><a href=\"/opinion/111860/cts-corp-v-dynamics-corp-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1987).\n   In any event, even the Baze plurality opinion provides\nno support for the Court’s proposition. To be sure, that\nopinion contains the following sentence: “[The condemned]\nmust show that the risk is substantial when compared to\nthe known and available alternatives.” 553 U. S., at 61.\nBut the meaning of that key sentence and the limits of the\nrequirement it imposed are made clear by the sentence\ndirectly preceding it: “A stay of execution may not be\ngranted on grounds such as those asserted here unless the\ncondemned prisoner establishes that the State’s lethal\ninjection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe\npain.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In Baze, the very premise\nof the petitioners’ Eighth Amendment claim was that they\nhad “identified a significant risk of harm [in Kentucky’s\nprotocol] that [could] be eliminated by adopting alterna­\ntive procedures.” Id., at 51. Their basic theory was that\neven if the risk of pain was only, say, 25%, that risk would\nbe objectively intolerable if there was an obvious alterna­\ntive that would reduce the risk to 5%. See Brief for Peti­\ntioners in Baze v. Rees, O. T. 2007, No. 07–5439, p. 29 (“In\nview of the severity of the pain risked and the ease with\nwhich it could be avoided, Petitioners should not have\nbeen required to show a high likelihood that they would\nsuffer such pain . . . ”). Thus, the “grounds . . . asserted”\nfor relief in Baze were that the State’s protocol was intol­\n\f26                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nerably risky given the alternative procedures the State\ncould have employed.\n   Addressing this claim, the Baze plurality clarified that\n“a condemned prisoner cannot successfully challenge a\nState’s method of execution merely by showing a slightly\nor marginally safer alternative,” 553 U. S., at 51; instead,\nto succeed in a challenge of this type, the comparative risk\nmust be “substantial,” id., at 61. Nowhere did the plurality\nsuggest that all challenges to a State’s method of execu­\ntion would require this sort of comparative-risk analysis.\nRecognizing the relevance of available alternatives is not\nat all the same as concluding that their absence precludes\na claimant from showing that a chosen method carries\nobjectively intolerable risks. If, for example, prison offi­\ncials chose a method of execution that has a 99% chance of\ncausing lingering and excruciating pain, certainly that\nrisk would be objectively intolerable whether or not the\nofficials ignored other methods in making this choice.\nIrrespective of the existence of alternatives, there are\nsome risks “so grave that it violates contemporary stand­\nards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to” them.\nHelling v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1993) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   That the Baze plurality’s statement regarding a con­\ndemned inmate’s ability to point to an available alterna­\ntive means of execution pertained only to challenges prem­\nised on the existence of such alternatives is further\nevidenced by the opinion’s failure to distinguish or even\nmention the Court’s unanimous decision in Hill v.\nMcDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145647\"><a href=\"/opinion/145647/hill-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Hill held that a §1983 plain­\ntiff challenging a State’s method of execution need not\n“identif[y] an alternative, authorized method of execution.”\nId., at 582. True, as the Court notes, ante, at 14–15, Hill\ndid so in the context of addressing §1983’s pleading stand­\nard, rejecting the proposed alternative-means requirement\nbecause the Court saw no basis for the “[i]mposition of\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

S., at 582.\nBut that only confirms that the Court in Hill did not view\nthe availability of an alternative means of execution as an\nelement of an Eighth Amendment claim: If it had, then\nrequiring the plaintiff to plead this element would not\nhave meant imposing a heightened standard at all, but\nrather would have been entirely consistent with “tradi­\ntional pleading requirements.” Ibid.; see Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (2009). The Baze plurality opinion\nshould not be understood to have so carelessly tossed aside\nHill’s underlying premise less than two years later.\n                              C\n   In reengineering Baze to support its newfound rule, the\nCourt appears to rely on a flawed syllogism. If the death\npenalty is constitutional, the Court reasons, then there\nmust be a means of accomplishing it, and thus some avail­\nable method of execution must be constitutional. See ante,\nat 4, 15–16. But even accepting that the death penalty is,\nin the abstract, consistent with evolving standards of\ndecency, but see ante, p. ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting), the\nCourt’s conclusion does not follow. The constitutionality of\nthe death penalty may inform our conception of the degree\nof pain that would render a particular method of imposing\nit unconstitutional. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 47 (plurality\nopinion) (because “[s]ome risk of pain is inherent in any\nmethod of execution,” “[i]t is clear . . . the Constitution\ndoes not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain”). But a\nmethod of execution that is “barbarous,” Rhodes, 452\nU. S., at 345, or “involve[s] torture or a lingering death,”\nKemmler, 136 U. S., at 447, does not become less so just\nbecause it is the only method currently available to a\nState. If all available means of conducting an execution\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment, then conducting\nthe execution will constitute cruel and usual punishment.\nNothing compels a State to perform an execution. It does\n\f28                        GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot get a constitutional free pass simply because it desires\nto deliver the ultimate penalty; its ends do not justify any\nand all means. If a State wishes to carry out an execution,\nit must do so subject to the constraints that our Constitu­\ntion imposes on it, including the obligation to ensure that\nits chosen method is not cruel and unusual. Certainly the\ncondemned has no duty to devise or pick a constitutional\ninstrument of his or her own death.\n   For these reasons, the Court’s available-alternative\nrequirement leads to patently absurd consequences.\nPetitioners contend that Oklahoma’s current protocol is a\nbarbarous method of punishment—the chemical equiva­\nlent of being burned alive. But under the Court’s new\nrule, it would not matter whether the State intended to\nuse midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and\nquartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at\nthe stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availabil­\nity of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could\nexecute them using whatever means it designated. But\nsee Baze, 553 U. S., at 101–102 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (“It strains credulity to suggest that the defin­\ning characteristic of burning at the stake, disemboweling,\ndrawing and quartering, beheading, and the like was that\nthey involved risks of pain that could be eliminated by\nusing alternative methods of execution”).8 The Eighth\nAmendment cannot possibly countenance such a result.\n                            D\n In concocting this additional requirement, the Court is\nmotivated by a desire to preserve States’ ability to conduct\n——————\n   8 The Court protests that its holding does not extend so far, deriding\n\nthis description of the logical implications of its legal rule as “simply\nnot true” and “outlandish rhetoric.” Ante, at 29. But presumably when\nthe Court imposes a “requirement o[n] all Eighth Amendment method-\nof-execution claims,” that requirement in fact applies to “all” methods\nof execution, without exception.

See\nante, at 4–6, 27–28. It is true, as the Court details, that\nStates have faced “practical obstacle[s]” to obtaining lethal\ninjection drugs since Baze was decided. Ante, at 4. One\nstudy concluded that recent years have seen States change\ntheir protocols “with a frequency that is unprecedented\namong execution methods in this country’s history.” Denno,\nLethal Injection Chaos Post-Baze, 102 Geo. L. J. 1331,\n1335 (2014).\n   But why such developments compel the Court’s imposi­\ntion of further burdens on those facing execution is a\nmystery. Petitioners here had no part in creating the\nshortage of execution drugs; it is odd to punish them for\nthe actions of pharmaceutical companies and others who\nseek to disassociate themselves from the death penalty—\nactions which are, of course, wholly lawful. Nor, certainly,\nshould these rapidly changing circumstances give us any\ngreater confidence that the execution methods ultimately\nselected will be sufficiently humane to satisfy the Eighth\nAmendment. Quite the contrary. The execution protocols\nStates hurriedly devise as they scramble to locate new and\nuntested drugs, see supra, at 3, are all the more likely to\nbe cruel and unusual—presumably, these drugs would\nhave been the States’ first choice were they in fact more\neffective. But see Denno, The Lethal Injection Quandry:\nHow Medicine Has Dismantled the Death Penalty, 76\nFord. L. Rev. 49, 65–79 (2007) (describing the hurried and\nunreasoned process by which States first adopted the\noriginal three-drug protocol). Courts’ review of execution\nmethods should be more, not less, searching when States\nare engaged in what is in effect human experimentation.\n   It is also worth noting that some condemned inmates\nmay read the Court’s surreal requirement that they iden­\ntify the means of their death as an invitation to propose\nmethods of executions less consistent with modern sensi­\nbilities. Petitioners here failed to meet the Court’s new\n\f30                   GLOSSIP v.

See ante, at 13–\n14. This was perhaps a reasonable assumption, especially\ngiven that neighboring Texas and Missouri still to this day\ncontinue to use pentobarbital in executions. See The\nDeath Penalty Institute, Execution List 2015, online at\nwww.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2015 (as visited\nJune 26, 2015, and available in the Clerk of the Court’s\ncase file).\n   In the future, however, condemned inmates might well\ndecline to accept States’ current reliance on lethal injec­\ntion. In particular, some inmates may suggest the firing\nsquad as an alternative. Since the 1920’s, only Utah has\nutilized this method of execution. See S. Banner, The\nDeath Penalty 203 (2002); Johnson, Double Murderer\nExecuted by Firing Squad in Utah, N. Y. Times, June 19,\n2010, p. A12. But there is evidence to suggest that the\nfiring squad is significantly more reliable than other\nmethods, including lethal injection using the various\ncombinations of drugs thus far developed. See A. Sarat,\nGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s\nDeath Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that\nwhile 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection\nbetween 1900 and 2010 were “botched,” none of the 34\nexecutions by firing squad had been). Just as important,\nthere is some reason to think that it is relatively quick and\npainless. See Banner, supra, at 203.\n   Certainly, use of the firing squad could be seen as a\ndevolution to a more primitive era. See Wood v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1103 (CA9 2014) (Kozinski, C.
