<quote local_id="1690" start="9934" end="10357" string="&quot;It seems to me that that is exactly the situation here: Kessler was solely entitled to receive the proceeds of the accounts payable pledged by Milne, and he so remained down to the time of these bankruptcies. These accounts were, to be sure, security for all the notes that Kessler had, but when he assigned some of the notes he became a trustee for his assignee to the extent of the face value of the notes in question.

<quote local_id="1691" start="10682" end="11295" string="&quot;It can make no difference that a holder of collateral securing several notes assigns them successively and thereby diminishes the value of each note in the event of deficiency. Each cestui que trust takes his chances of that, but if (in this case) Kessler became a trustee for the bank by the act of assignment, no act of his, nor any change in his circumstances can change his relation to the cestui que trust he himself created. To the extent of his ability he is at all times bound to account for the trust he had himself created, and that duty has by operation of law descended to his trustee in bankruptcy.&quot;">
