As mistaken as the Court is in its view of Congress' purpose in enacting ยง 8(a)(3), the Court is even more mistaken in its reliance on this Court's interpretation of ยง 2, Eleventh in Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961). The text of ยง 8(a)(3) of the NLRA is, of course, very much like the text of the later enacted ยง 2, Eleventh of the RLA. This similarity, however, does not dictate the conclusion that the 1947 Congress intended ยง 8(a)(3) to have a meaning identical to that which the 1951 Congress intended ยง 2, Eleventh to have. The Court previously has held that the scope of the RLA is not identical to that of the NLRA and that courts should be wary of drawing parallels between the two statutes. *777 See, e. g., First National Maintenance Corp. v. NLRB, 452 U.S. 666, 686, n. 23 (1981); Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U.S. 369, 383 (1969). Thus, parallels between ยง 8(a)(3) and ยง 2, Eleventh, &quot;"></quote>

In order to overcome this inevitable conclusion, the Court relies on remarks made by a few Members of the Congress in enacting the 1951 amendments to ยง 2, Eleventh of the RLA, which the Court contends show that the 1951 Congress viewed those amendments as identical to the amendments that had been made to ยง 8(a)(3) of the NLRA in 1947. See ante, at 756; see also ante, at 746, and n. 4. But even assuming the Court's view of the legislative history of ยง 2, Eleventh *779 is correct (and the legislative materials do not obviously impart the message the Court receives[14]), it does not provide support for the Court's strained reading of ยง 8(a)(3).

Those sources show that the 1947 Congress did not intend ยง 8(a)(3) to have the same meaning the Court has attributed to ยง 2, Eleventh of the RLA.

III In sum, I conclude that, in enacting ยง 8(a)(3) of the NLRA, Congress did not intend to prohibit union-security agreements that require the tender of full union dues and standard union initiation fees from nonmember employees, without regard to how the union expends the funds so collected. In finding controlling weight in this Court's interpretation of ยง 2, Eleventh of the RLA to reach a contrary conclusion, the Court has not only eschewed our well-established methods of statutory construction, but also interpreted the terms of ยง 8(a)(3) in a manner inconsistent with the congressional purpose clearly expressed in the statutory language and amply documented in the legislative history.
