DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–1163. Argued December 1, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to\n  make Government records available to the public, subject to nine ex\n  emptions. This case concerns Exemption 2, which protects from dis\n  closure material “related solely to the internal personnel rules and\n  practices of an agency.” 5 U. S. C.§552(b)(2). This provision replaced\n  an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) exemption for “any matter\n  relating solely to the internal management of an agency,” 5 U. S. C.\n  §1002 (1964 ed.). Congress believed that the “sweep” of the phrase\n  “internal management” had led to excessive withholding, and drafted\n  Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Department of Air Force v.\n  Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362–363.\n    In Rose, the Court found that Exemption 2 could not be invoked to\n  withhold Air Force Academy honor and ethics hearing summaries.\n  The exemption, the Court suggested, primarily targets material con\n  cerning employee relations or human resources. But the Court stated\n  a possible caveat: That understanding of the provision’s coverage\n  governed “at least where the situation is not one where disclosure\n  may risk circumvention of agency regulation.” Id., at 369. The D. C.\n  Circuit subsequently converted this caveat into a new definition of\n  Exemption 2’s scope, finding that the exemption also covered any\n  “predominantly internal” materials whose disclosure would “signifi\n  cantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulation or statutes.” Crooker\n  v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F. 2d 1051, 1056–\n  1057, 1074. Courts now use the term “Low 2” for human resources\n  and employee relations records and “High 2” for records whose disclo\n  sure would risk circumvention of the law.\n    Petitioner Milner submitted FOIA requests for explosives data and\n  maps used by respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Govern\n\f2                MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    ment) in storing munitions at a naval base in Washington State.\n    Stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and\n    surrounding community, the Navy invoked Exemption 2 and refused\n    to release the data. The District Court granted the Navy summary\n    judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2\n    interpretation.\nHeld: Because Exemption 2 encompasses only records relating to em\n ployee relations and human resources issues, the explosives maps\n and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that\n exemption. Pp. 6–19.\n    (a) Exemption 2 shields only those records relating to “personnel\n rules and practices.” When used as an adjective in this manner, the\n key statutory word “personnel” refers to human resources matters.\n For example, a “personnel department” deals with employee prob\n lems and interviews applicants for jobs. FOIA Exemption 6 provides\n another example, protecting certain “personnel . . . files” from disclo\n sure. §552(b)(6). “[T]he common and congressional meaning of . . .\n ‘personnel file’ ” is a file maintained by a human resources office col\n lecting personal information about employees, such as examination\n results and work performance evaluations. Rose, supra, at 377. Ex\n emption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way. An agency’s “per\n sonnel rules and practices” all share a critical feature: They concern\n conditions of employment in federal agencies—such matters as hiring\n and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.\n These items currently fall within the so-called Low 2 exemption. And\n under this Court’s construction of the statutory language, Low 2 is all\n of 2.\n    FOIA’s purpose reinforces this reading. The statute’s goal is\n “broad disclosure,” and the exemptions must be “given a narrow com\n pass.” Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151. A\n narrow construction stands on especially firm footing with respect to\n Exemption 2, which was intended to hem in the expansive withhold\n ing that occurred under the prior APA exemption for “internal man\n agement” records.\n    Exemption 2, as interpreted here, does not reach the requested ex\n plosives information. The data and maps, which calculate and visu\n ally portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations, in no way re\n late to “personnel rules and practices,” as that term is most naturally\n understood. Pp. 6–10.\n    (b) The Government’s two alternative readings of Exemption 2\n cannot be squared with the statute. Pp. 10–17.\n    (c) While the Navy has a strong security interest in shielding the\n explosives data and maps from public disclosure, the Government\n has other tools at hand to protect such information: FOIA Exemption\n\f                     Cite as: 562 U.

The Navy’s ar-\n  gument that the explosives information is exempt under Exemption 7\n  remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand. And if\n  these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would\n  threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the Government may of course\n  seek relief from Congress.

DEPARTMENT\n               OF THE NAVY\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 7, 2011]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. §552,\nrequires federal agencies to make Government records\navailable to the public, subject to nine exemptions for\nspecific categories of material. This case concerns the\nscope of Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure\nmaterial that is “related solely to the internal personnel\nrules and practices of an agency.” §552(b)(2). Respondent\nDepartment of the Navy (Navy or Government) invoked\nExemption 2 to deny a FOIA request for data and maps\nused to help store explosives at a naval base in Washing\nton State. We hold that Exemption 2 does not stretch so\nfar.\n                           I\n  Congress enacted FOIA to overhaul the public\ndisclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA), 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). That section of the\nAPA “was plagued with vague phrases” and gradually\nbecame more “a withholding statute than a disclosure\nstatute.” EPA v. Mink, 410 U. S. 73, 79 (1973). Congress\nintended FOIA to “permit access to official information\n\f2            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlong shielded unnecessarily from public view.” Id., at 80.\nFOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose records on\nrequest, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.\nThese exemptions are “explicitly made exclusive,” id., at\n79, and must be “narrowly construed,” FBI v. Abramson,\n456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982).\n  At issue here is Exemption 2, which shields from com\npelled disclosure documents “related solely to the internal\npersonnel rules and practices of an agency.” §552(b)(2).\nCongress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA’s ex\nemption for “any matter relating solely to the internal\nmanagement of an agency,” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.).\nBelieving that the “sweep” of the phrase “internal man\nagement” had led to excessive withholding, Congress\ndrafted Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Depart\nment of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362–363 (1976).\n  We considered the extent of that reach in Department of\nAir Force v. Rose. There, we rejected the Government’s\ninvocation of Exemption 2 to withhold case summaries of\nhonor and ethics hearings at the United States Air Force\nAcademy. The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets\nmaterial concerning employee relations or human re\nsources: “use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch\nhours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”\nId., at 363 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n8 (1965) (hereinafter S. Rep.)); see Rose, 425 U. S., at 367.\n“[T]he general thrust” of Exemption 2, we explained, “is\nsimply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and\nmaintaining [such information] for public inspection.” Id.,\nat 369. We concluded that the case summaries did not fall\nwithin the exemption because they “d[id] not concern only\nroutine matters” of “merely internal significance.” Id., at\n370. But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation\nof Exemption 2: That understanding of the provision’s\ncoverage governed, we wrote, “at least where the situation\n\f                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nis not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of\nagency regulation.” Id., at 369.\n   In Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,\n670 F. 2d 1051 (1981), the D. C. Circuit converted this\ncaveat into a new definition of Exemption 2’s scope.\nCrooker approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a man\nual designed to train Government agents in law enforce\nment surveillance techniques. The D. C. Circuit noted\nthat it previously had understood Exemption 2 to “refe[r]\nonly to ‘pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch\nhours, parking, etc.’ ” Id., at 1056 (quoting Jordan v.\nDepartment of Justice, 591 F. 2d 753, 763 (1978)). But the\ncourt now thought Exemption 2 should also cover any\n“predominantly internal” materials,1 Crooker, 670 F. 2d,\nat 1056–1057, whose disclosure would “significantly ris[k]\ncircumvention of agency regulations or statutes,” id., at\n1074. This construction of Exemption 2, the court rea\nsoned, flowed from FOIA’s “overall design,” its legislative\nhistory, “and even common sense,” because Congress could\nnot have meant to “enac[t] a statute whose provisions\nundermined . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement\nagencies.” Ibid.\n   In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted\nthe D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of Exemption 2. See 575\nF. 3d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below); Massey v. FBI, 3\nF. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d\n884, 889 (CA7 1988).2 And that interpretation spawned a\n——————\n  1 The court adopted the “predominantly internal” standard as a way\n\nof implementing the exemption’s requirement that materials “relat[e]\nsolely to” an agency’s internal personnel rules and practices. The\nword “solely,” the court reasoned, “has to be given the construction,\nconsonant with reasonableness, of ‘predominantly’ ” because otherwise\n“solely” would conflict with the expansive term “related.” 670 F. 2d, at\n1056 (some internal quotation marks omitted).\n  2 Three other Courts of Appeals had previously taken a narrower view\n\nof Exemption 2’s scope, consistent with the interpretation adopted in\n\f4               MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnew terminology: Courts applying the Crooker approach\nnow refer to the “Low 2” exemption when discussing mate\nrials concerning human resources and employee relations,\nand to the “High 2” exemption when assessing records\nwhose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.\nSee, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 963; Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F. 2d\n1205, 1208 (CADC 1992). Congress, as well, took notice of\nthe D. C. Circuit’s decision, borrowing language from\nCrooker to amend Exemption 7(E) when next enacting\nrevisions to FOIA. The amended version of Exemption\n7(E) shields certain “records or information compiled for\nlaw enforcement purposes” if their disclosure “could rea\nsonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”\n§552(b)(7)(E); see Freedom of Information Reform Act of\n1986, §1802(a), 100 Stat. 3207–49.\n                           II\n   The FOIA request at issue here arises from the Navy’s\noperations at Naval Magazine Indian Island, a base in\nPuget Sound, Washington. The Navy keeps weapons,\nammunition, and explosives on the island. To aid in the\nstorage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses\ndata known as Explosive Safety Quantity Distance\n(ESQD) information. 575 F. 3d, at 962. ESQD informa\ntion prescribes “minimum separation distances” for explo\nsives and helps the Navy design and construct storage\n——————\nRose. See Cox v. Department of Justice, 576 F. 2d 1302, 1309–1310\n(CA8 1978) (concluding that Exemption 2 covers only an agency’s\ninternal “housekeeping matters” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nStokes v. Brennan, 476 F. 2d 699, 703 (CA5 1973) (holding that Exemp\ntion 2 “must not be read so broadly as to exempt” an Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration manual for training compliance\nofficers); Hawkes v. IRS, 467 F. 2d 787, 797 (CA6 1972) (“[T]he internal\npractices and policies referred to in [Exemption 2] relate only to . . .\nemployee-employer type concerns”). These Circuits have never revised\ntheir understandings of the exemption. See infra, at 13, n. 7.\n\f                     Cite as: 562 U.

The ESQD calculations are often incorporated into\nspecialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical\nexplosions. See, e.g., App. 52.\n  In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen Milner, a Puget\nSound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD\ninformation relating to Indian Island. 575 F. 3d, at 962.\nThe Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclo\nsure would threaten the security of the base and surround\ning community. In support of its decision to withhold the\nrecords, the Navy invoked Exemption 2. Ibid.3\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nNavy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the\nHigh 2 interpretation developed in Crooker. 575 F. 3d, at\n963. The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD\ninformation “is predominantly used for the internal pur\npose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their\njobs.” Id., at 968. And disclosure of the material, the\ncourt determined, “would risk circumvention of the law”\nby “point[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreak\ning havoc”—for example, “[a] terrorist who wished to hit\nthe most damaging target.” Id., at 971. The ESQD infor\nmation, the court concluded, therefore qualified for a High\n2 exemption. 575 F. 3d, at 971.\n  We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split re\nspecting Exemption 2’s meaning, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and\nwe now reverse.\n\n——————\n  3 The Navy also invoked Exemption 7(F), which applies to “records or\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the\nextent that the production of such . . . records . . . could reasonably be\nexpected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.” 5\nU. S. C. §552(b)(7)(F). The courts below did not decide whether the\nNavy could withhold the ESQD data under that exemption. 575 F. 3d\n959, 971, n. 8 (CA9 2009); No. CV–06–01301 (WD Wash., Oct. 30, 2007),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 4, 25, 2007 WL 3228049, *8.\n\f6             MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III \n\n   Our consideration of Exemption 2’s scope starts with its\ntext. See, e.g., Park ’N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,\n469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) (“Statutory construction must\nbegin with the language employed by Congress and the\nassumption that the ordinary meaning of that language\naccurately expresses the legislative purpose”). Judicial\ndecisions since FOIA’s enactment have analyzed and\nreanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But compara\ntively little attention has focused on the provision’s 12\nsimple words: “related solely to the internal personnel\nrules and practices of an agency.”\n   The key word in that dozen—the one that most clearly\nmarks the provision’s boundaries—is “personnel.” When\nused as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and\npractices,” that term refers to human resources matters.\n“Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selec\ntion, placement, and training of employees and . . . the\nformulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or\ninvolving] employees or their representatives.” Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinaf\nter Webster’s). So, for example, a “personnel department”\nis “the department of a business firm that deals with\nproblems affecting the employees of the firm and that\nusually interviews applicants for jobs.” Random House\nDictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House).\n“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of man\nagement concerned with the engagement and effective\nutilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of\nhuman resources.” Webster’s 1687. And a “personnel\nagency” is “an agency for placing employable persons in\njobs; employment agency.” Random House 1075.\n   FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemp\ntion 6. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143\n(1994) (“A term appearing in several places in a statutory\n\f                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntext is generally read the same way each time it appears”).\nThat exemption, just a few short paragraphs down from\nExemption 2, protects from disclosure “personnel and\nmedical files and similar files the disclosure of which\nwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of per\nsonal privacy.” §552(b)(6). Here too, the statute uses the\nterm “personnel” as a modifier meaning “human re\nsources.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32 (“[The Court:] It’s [an]\nH. R. file, right? [The Government:] That’s generally\ntrue”). As we recognized in Rose, “the common and con\ngressional meaning of . . . ‘personnel file’ ” is the file “show\ning, for example, where [an employee] was born, the\nnames of his parents, where he has lived from time to\ntime, his . . . school records, results of examinations, [and]\nevaluations of his work performance.” 425 U. S., at 377.\nIt is the file typically maintained in the human resources\noffice—otherwise known (to recall an example offered\nabove) as the “personnel department.” Ibid.\n   Exemption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way.\nAn agency’s “personnel rules and practices” are its rules\nand practices dealing with employee relations or human\nresources. The D. C. Circuit, in a pre-Crooker decision,\ngave as examples “matters relating to pay, pensions,\nvacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.”\nJordan, 591 F. 2d, at 763; see supra, at 3. That “etc.” is\nimportant; we doubt any court could know enough about\nthe Federal Government’s operations to formulate a com\nprehensive list. But all the rules and practices referenced\nin Exemption 2 share a critical feature: They concern the\nconditions of employment in federal agencies—such mat\nters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, com\npensation and benefits.4 Courts in practice have had little\n——————\n  4 Government records also must satisfy the other requirements of\n\nExemption 2 to be exempt from disclosure. Information must “relat[e]\nsolely”—meaning, as usual, “exclusively or only,” Random House 1354\n\f8               MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndifficulty identifying the records that qualify for withhold\ning under this reading: They are what now commonly fall\nwithin the Low 2 exemption. Our construction of the\nstatutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of\n2 (and that High 2 is not 2 at all, see infra, at 10–14).\n   The statute’s purpose reinforces this understanding of\nthe exemption. We have often noted “the Act’s goal of\nbroad disclosure” and insisted that the exemptions be\n“given a narrow compass.” Department of Justice v. Tax\nAnalysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151 (1989); see Department of\nInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Assn., 532 U. S.\n1, 7–8 (2001).5 This practice of “constru[ing] FOIA exemp\ntions narrowly,” Department of Justice v. Landano, 508\nU. S. 165, 181 (1993), stands on especially firm footing\nwith respect to Exemption 2. As described earlier, Con\ngress worded that provision to hem in the prior APA ex\nemption for “any matter relating solely to the internal\nmanagement of an agency,” which agencies had used to\nprevent access to masses of documents. See Rose, 425\nU. S., at 362. We would ill-serve Congress’s purpose by\n——————\n—to the agency’s “personnel rules and practices.” And the information\nmust be “internal”; that is, the agency must typically keep the records\nto itself for its own use. See Webster’s 1180 (“internal” means “existing\nor situated within the limits . . . of something”). An agency’s human\nresources documents will often meet these conditions.\n   5 The dissent would reject this longstanding rule of construction in\n\nfavor of an approach asking courts “to turn Congress’ public informa\ntion objectives into workable agency practice.” Post, at 8–9 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). But nothing in FOIA either explicitly or implicitly grants\ncourts discretion to expand (or contract) an exemption on this basis. In\nenacting FOIA, Congress struck the balance it thought right—generally\nfavoring disclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions—\nand did so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government.\nSee, e.g., John Doe Agency v.

Our reading\ninstead gives the exemption the “narrower reach” Con\ngress intended, id., at 363, through the simple device of\nconfining the provision’s meaning to its words.\n   The Government resists giving “personnel” its plain\nmeaning on the ground that Congress, when drafting\nExemption 2, considered but chose not to enact language\nexempting “internal employment rules and practices.”\nBrief for Respondent 30–34, and n. 11. This drafting\nhistory, the Navy maintains, proves that Congress did not\nwish “to limit the Exemption to employment-related mat\nters,” id., at 31, even if the adjective “personnel” conveys\nthat meaning in other contexts, id., at 41. But we think\nthe Navy’s evidence insufficient: The scant history con\ncerning this word change as easily supports the inference\nthat Congress merely swapped one synonym for another.\nCf. Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U. S. 714, 723 (1989) (noting\nwith respect to the “unexplained disappearance of one\nword from an unenacted bill” that “mute intermediate\nlegislative maneuvers are not reliable” aids to statutory\ninterpretation (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those\nof us who make use of legislative history believe that clear\nevidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambigu\nous text. We will not take the opposite tack of allowing\nambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory\nlanguage.\n   Exemption 2, as we have construed it, does not reach\nthe ESQD information at issue here. These data and\nmaps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of\nhypothetical detonations. By no stretch of imagination do\nthey relate to “personnel rules and practices,” as that term\nis most naturally understood. They concern the physical\nrules governing explosives, not the workplace rules gov\nerning sailors; they address the handling of dangerous\n\f10            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmaterials, not the treatment of employees. The Navy\ntherefore may not use Exemption 2, interpreted in accord\nwith its plain meaning to cover human resources matters,\nto prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.\n                           IV\n   The Government offers two alternative readings of\nExemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD informa\ntion. We cannot square either with the statute.\n                              A\n   The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction\nof Exemption 2 pioneered by Crooker, which shields mate\nrial not only if it meets the criteria set out above (Low 2),\nbut also if it is “predominant[ly] interna[l]” and its “disclo\nsure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal\nagency functions” (High 2). Brief for Respondent 41 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors\nthis reading of the statute. Post, at 1. But the Crooker\ninterpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent\nflaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2’s text. The High\n2 test (in addition to substituting the word “predomi\nnantly” for “solely,” see n. 1, supra) ignores the plain\nmeaning of the adjective “personnel,” see supra, at 6–9,\nand adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or\nreferent in Exemption 2’s language. Indeed, the only way\nto arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute—\n“cutting out some” words and “pasting in others” until\nlittle of the actual provision remains. Elliott v. Depart\nment of Agriculture, 596 F. 3d 842, 845 (CADC 2010).\nBecause this is so, High 2 is better labeled “Non 2” (and\nLow 2 . . . just 2).\n   In support of its text-light approach to the statute, the\nGovernment relies primarily on legislative history, placing\nparticular emphasis on the House Report concerning\nFOIA. See Brief for Respondent 33–38. A statement in\nthat Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the\n\f                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexemption and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2\nconstruction. According to the Report: “Operating rules,\nguidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government\ninvestigators or examiners would be exempt from disclo\nsure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption would not\ncover . . . employee relations and working conditions and\nroutine administrative procedures.” H. R. Rep. No. 1497,\n89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). But the Senate Report\nsays exactly the opposite, explaining in support of a Low 2\ninterpretation that the phrase “internal personnel rules\nand practices of an agency” means “rules as to personnel’s\nuse of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,\nstatements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”\nS. Rep., at 8.6 In Rose, we gave reasons for thinking the\nSenate Report the more reliable of the two. See 425 U. S.,\nat 366. But the more fundamental point is what we said\nbefore: Legislative history, for those who take it into ac\ncount, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it. See\nsupra, at 9; Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 49\n(1950) (declining to consult legislative history when that\n“history is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous”).\nWhen presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory\nlanguage and, on the other, with dueling committee re\nports, we must choose the language.\n  The Government also advances, in support of Crooker’s\nHigh 2 approach, an argument based on subsequent legis\nlative action. Congress, the Government notes, amended\nExemption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records\nwhose production “would disclose techniques and proce\ndures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,\n\n——————\n  6 We are perplexed that the dissent takes seriously Crooker’s notion\n\nthat the reports are “reconcilable.” Post, at 4. To strip the matter to its\nessentials, the House Report says: “Exemption 2 means A, but not B.”\nThe Senate Report says: “Exemption 2 means B.” That is the very\ndefinition of “irreconcilable.”\n\f12           MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investi\ngations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reason\nably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”\n§552(b)(7)(E). That amendment, the Government con\ntends, codified Crooker’s “circumvention of the law” stan\ndard and, in so doing, ratified Crooker’s holding. Brief for\nRespondent 42–43. The dissent likewise counts as signifi\ncant that Congress “t[ook] note” of Crooker in revising\nFOIA. Post, at 9; see post, at 2.\n   But the Government and the dissent neglect the key\nfeature of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not\nExemption 2 (the subject of Crooker), but instead Exemp\ntion 7(E). And the Crooker construction of Exemption 2\nrenders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that\namendment of any effect. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews,\n534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should\nbe read to avoid making any provision “superfluous, void,\nor insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ncannot think of any document eligible for withholding\nunder Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not\ncapture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the\nlaw enforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are\n“predominantly internal.” So if Congress had agreed with\nCrooker’s reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no\nreason to alter Exemption 7(E). In that event, Congress\nwould either have left the statute alone (on the theory that\nCrooker would do the necessary work) or would have\namended Exemption 2 specifically to ratify Crooker. The\ndecision instead to amend Exemption 7(E) suggests that\nCongress approved the circumvention standard only as to\nlaw enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of\nrecords High 2 covers. Perhaps this legislative action does\nnot show that Congress affirmatively disagreed with\nCrooker; maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the\ncircumvention standard should apply to other records.\nBut one thing is clear: The 1986 amendment does not\n\f                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nratify, approve, or otherwise signal agreement with\nCrooker’s interpretation of Exemption 2. This argument\ntherefore cannot save the High 2 construction.\n  The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2,\nand indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.\nCrooker, the dissent asserts, “has been consistently relied\nupon and followed for 30 years” by other lower courts.\nPost, at 9; see post, at 1–2. But this claim, too, trips at the\nstarting gate. It would be immaterial even if true, because\nwe have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on\nthe ground that other courts have done so. And in any\nevent, it is not true. Prior to Crooker, three Circuits\nadopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and\nthey have not changed their minds. See n. 2, supra.7\n——————\n  7 The  dissent’s view that “two of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed]\nto their early positions” is incorrect. Post, at 2. In Abraham & Rose,\nP.L.C. v. United States, cited by the dissent, the Sixth Circuit rejected\nthe Government’s claim that Exemption 2 shielded records of federal\ntax lien filings. 138 F. 3d 1075, 1082 (1998). The court nowhere\ndiscussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here. Its only\nreference to Crooker concerned the part of that decision interpreting\n“solely” to mean “predominantly.” See 138 F.3d, at 1080; see also n. 1,\nsupra. Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in Rugiero v.\nDepartment of Justice, that Exemption 2 applies to “routine matters of\nmerely internal significance.” 257 F. 3d 534, 549 (2001). In Sladek v.\nBensinger, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that\nthe Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s\nmanual because it “is not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of\nparking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2.” 605 F. 2d 899, 902\n(1979). In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court\nacknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.\nThe court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation\nbecause it would not have changed the case’s outcome. See ibid.\nFinally, the Eighth Circuit’s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the\ndissent does not say otherwise. The exemption, according to that most\nrecent Eighth Circuit decision, applies “only [to an agency’s] housekeep\ning matters.” Cox, 576 F. 2d, at 1309–1310 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The dissent is surely right to say, post at 2, that Crooker “has\nguided nearly every FOIA case decided over the last 30 years” in\n\f14              MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSince Crooker, three other Circuits have accepted the High\n2 reading. See supra, at 3. One Circuit has reserved\njudgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. See Audubon\nSociety v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203–1204 (CA10\n1997). And the rest have not considered the matter. (No\none should think Crooker has been extensively discussed\nor debated in the Courts of Appeals. In the past three\ndecades, Crooker’s analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited\na sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions\noutside the D. C. Circuit—on average, once every six\nyears.) The result is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.8\nWe will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation\nto take the side of the bare majority.\n                              B\n   Presumably because Crooker so departs from Exemption\n2’s language, the Government also offers another con\nstruction, which it says we might adopt “on a clean slate,”\n“based on the plain text . . . alone.” Brief for Respondent\n15. On this reading, the exemption “encompasses records\nconcerning an agency’s internal rules and practices for its\npersonnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental\nfunctions.” Id., at 20; see also id., at 13–14 (Exemption 2\n“applies generally to matters concerning internal rules\nand practices to guide agency personnel in performing\n——————\nCircuits applying Crooker; but that statement does not hold in the\nCircuits using the Low 2 approach.\n   8 Notably, even those courts approving Crooker have disagreed about\n\nhow to apply High 2. Fault lines include whether the risk of circum\nvention must be significant, see, e.g., Hidalgo v. FBI, 541 F. Supp. 2d\n250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15–16; whether courts should con\nsider the public interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see,\ne.g., Department of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act,\np. 185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person or\nentity threatening circumvention; compare, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 971, with,\ne.g., id., at 978 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting). The disagreement is not\nsurprising. Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts\nlack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage.\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir duties”). According to the Government, this inter\npretation makes sense because “the phrase ‘personnel\nrules and practices of an agency’ is logically understood to\nmean an agency’s rules and practices for its personnel.”\nId., at 20 (emphasis added).\n   But the purported logic in the Government’s definition\neludes us. We would not say, in ordinary parlance, that a\n“personnel file” is any file an employee uses, or that a\n“personnel department” is any department in which an\nemployee serves. No more would we say that a “personnel\nrule or practice” is any rule or practice that assists an\nemployee in doing her job. The use of the term “personnel”\nin each of these phrases connotes not that the file or de\npartment or practice/rule is for personnel, but rather that\nthe file or department or practice/rule is about personnel—\ni.e., that it relates to employee relations or human re\nsources. This case well illustrates the point. The records\nrequested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps\nshowing the distances that potential blasts travel. This\ninformation no doubt assists Navy personnel in storing\nmunitions. But that is not to say that the data and maps\nrelate to “personnel rules and practices.” No one staring\nat these charts of explosions and using ordinary language\nwould describe them in this manner.\n   Indeed, the Government’s “clean slate” construction\nreaches such documents only by stripping the word “per\nsonnel” of any real meaning. Under this interpretation,\nan agency’s “internal personnel rules and practices” ap\npears to mean all its internal rules and practices. That is\nbecause agencies necessarily operate through personnel,\nand so all their internal rules and practices are for per\nsonnel. The modifier “personnel,” then, does no modifying\nwork; it does not limit the class of internal rules and\npractices that Exemption 2 covers. What is most naturally\nviewed as the provision’s key word—the term that ought\n\f16              MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto define its scope—does nothing more than state the\ntruism that in an agency it is “personnel” who follow\ninternal rules and practices.\n   And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemp\ntion, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a dis\nclosure than “a withholding statute.” Mink, 410 U. S., at\n79. Many documents an agency generates in some way\naid employees in carrying out their responsibilities. If\nExemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend\nto engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the\nlimitations Congress placed on their application. Exemp\ntion 7, for example, shields records compiled for law en\nforcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria\nis met. §552(b)(7). Yet on the Government’s view, an\nagency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemp\ntion 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel\nin performing their duties. Indeed, an agency could use\nExemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to with\nhold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA’s\nmore targeted exemptions.9\n——————\n  9 The dissent asserts that “30 years of experience” with a more expan\nsive interpretation of the exemption suggests no “seriou[s] inter\nfere[nce] with . . . FOIA’s informational objectives.” Post, at 6. But\nthose objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based\non an improper interpretation of the statute. To give just one example,\nthe U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple\noccasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting\nsites. See Audubon Society v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10\n1997); Maricopa Audubon Soc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084\n(CA9 1997). And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies\nmay too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure. According to\namicus Public Citizen, “while reliance on exemptions overall rose 83%\nfrom 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose 344% during that\nsame time period.” Brief for Public Citizen et al. as Amici Curiae 24.\nIn 2009 alone, federal departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000\ntimes to prevent access to records. See Brief for Allied Daily Newspa\npers of Washington et al. as Amici Curiae 3. We do not doubt that\nmany of these FOIA denials were appropriate. But we are unable to\n\f                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2—call it “Super 2”\nnow—would extend, rather than narrow, the APA’s former\nexemption for records relating to the “internal manage\nment of an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). We doubt\nthat even the “internal management” provision, which\nCongress thought allowed too much withholding, see\nsupra, at 2, would have protected all information that\nguides employees in the discharge of their duties, includ\ning the explosives data and maps in this case. And per\nhaps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates\nthe rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions.\nSee, e.g., Abramson, 456 U. S., at 630; Rose, 425 U. S., at\n361. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or\npurpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.\n                              V\n   Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Gov\nernment proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy’s\ninterest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other\nsimilar information. The Government has informed us\nthat “[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would\nsignificantly risk undermining the Navy’s ability to safely\nand securely store military ordnance,” Brief for Respon\ndent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representa\ntion. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclo\nsure of this information could be used to “wrea[k] havoc”\nand “make catastrophe more likely.” 575 F. 3d, at 971.\nConcerns of this kind—a sense that certain sensitive\ninformation should be exempt from disclosure—in part led\nthe Crooker court to formulate the High 2 standard. See\n670 F. 2d, at 1074 (contending that “common sense” sup\nported the High 2 interpretation because Congress would\nnot have wanted FOIA to “undermin[e] . . . the effective\n——————\naccept the dissent’s unsupported declaration that a sweeping construc\ntion of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress’s goal of broad\ndisclosure.\n\f18            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nness of law enforcement agencies”). And we acknowledge\nthat our decision today upsets three decades of agency\npractice relying on Crooker, and therefore may force con\nsiderable adjustments.\n   We also note, however, that the Government has other\ntools at hand to shield national security information and\nother sensitive materials. Most notably, Exemption 1 of\nFOIA prevents access to classified documents. §552(b)(1);\nsee 575 F. 3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemp\ntion 1 is “specifically designed to allow government agen\ncies to withhold information that might jeopardize our\nnational security”). The Government generally may clas\nsify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see\nExec. Order No. 13526, §1.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009);\nan agency therefore may wait until that time to decide\nwhether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of\nclassification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. Exemption 3\nalso may mitigate the Government’s security concerns.\nThat provision applies to records that any other statute\nexempts from disclosure, §552(b)(3), thus offering Con\ngress an established, streamlined method to authorize the\nwithholding of specific records that FOIA would not oth\nerwise protect. And Exemption 7, as already noted, pro\ntects “information compiled for law enforcement purposes”\nthat meets one of six criteria, including if its release “could\nreasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical\nsafety of any individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). The Navy argued\nbelow that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemp\ntion 7(F), see n. 3, supra, and that claim remains open for\nthe Ninth Circuit to address on remand.\n   If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose\nrelease would threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the\nGovernment may of course seek relief from Congress. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold today is that Congress has\nnot enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.\n\f                  Cite as: 562 U.

DEPARTMENT\n               OF THE NAVY\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.\n   I agree with the Court that the text of Exemption 2 of\nthe Freedom of Information Act of 1966 cannot support\nthe “High 2” interpretation that courts have adopted and\napplied over the years. As the Court explains, however,\nthe Government may avail itself of numerous other ex\nemptions, see ante, at 18—exemptions that may have been\novershadowed in recent years by the broad reach of High\n2. I write separately to underscore the alternative argu\nment that the Navy raised below, which rested on Exemp\ntion 7(F) and which will remain open on remand. See\nante, at 5, n. 3, 18.\n   Exemption 7 applies to specific categories of information\n“compiled for law enforcement purposes.” 5 U. S. C.\n§552(b)(7). In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits with\nholding of “records or information compiled for law en\nforcement purposes” that, if disclosed, “could reasonably\nbe expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any\nindividual.” §552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving secu\nrity information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure\nmay “endanger the life or physical safety of any individ\nual.” A more difficult question, however, is whether the\ninformation is “compiled for law enforcement purposes.”\nSee John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146, 153\n(1989) (“Before it may invoke [Exemption 7], the Govern\n\f2             MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nment has the burden of proving the existence of . . . a\ncompilation for such a purpose”). In my view, this phrase\nreasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official\nsecurity and crime prevention duties.\n   “Law enforcement purposes.” The ordinary understand\ning of law enforcement includes not just the investigation\nand prosecution of offenses that have already been com\nmitted, but also proactive steps designed to prevent crimi\nnal activity and to maintain security. A “law enforcement\nofficer” is defined as one “whose duty it is to preserve the\npeace,” Black’s Law Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and\nfulfilling that duty involves a range of activities. Police on\nthe beat aim to prevent crime from occurring, and they no\nless carry out “law enforcement purposes” than officers\ninvestigating a crime scene. Similarly, a “law-enforcement\nagency” is charged with “the apprehension of alleged\noffenders as well as crime detection and prevention.” R. De\nSola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).\n   Crime prevention and security measures are critical to\neffective law enforcement as we know it. There can be no\ndoubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a\nlaw enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials\nfrom attack, even though no investigation may be ongoing.\nLikewise, steps by law enforcement officers to prevent\nterrorism surely fulfill “law enforcement purposes.” Par\nticularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and na\ntional security measures have been recognized as vital to\neffective law enforcement efforts in our Nation. Indeed,\n“[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,” the\npriorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation “shifted\ndramatically,” and the FBI’s “top priority became the\nprevention of another terrorist attack.” Hearings before\nthe Subcommittee on Science, the Departments of State,\nJustice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies of the\nHouse Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., pt. 10, 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nS. Mueller III). Today, “[t]he FBI’s number one priority\ncontinues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against\nthe United States.” Hearings before the Senate Commit\ntee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,\n111th Cong., 2d Sess, p. ___ (Sept. 22, 2010) (testimony of\nMueller). If crime prevention and security measures do\nnot serve “law enforcement purposes,” then those charged\nwith law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of\nfulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.\n  The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read natu\nrally, “law enforcement purposes” involve more than just\ninvestigation and prosecution. As Exemption 7’s subpara\ngraphs demonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these\nnarrower activities. See, e.g., §552(b)(7)(A) (information\nthat “could reasonably be expected to interfere with en\nforcement proceedings”); §552(b)(7)(E) (information that\n“would disclose techniques and procedures for law en\nforcement investigations or prosecutions”).       Congress’\ndecision to use different language to trigger Exemption 7\nconfirms that the concept of “law enforcement purposes”\nsweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution.\nSee Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9\n(2004) (applying the “usual rule” that “ when the legis\nlature uses certain language in one part of the statute\nand different language in another, the court assumes dif-\nferent meanings were intended” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  “Compiled for law enforcement purposes.” This Court\nhas given a fairly broad meaning to “compiled” under\n§552(b)(7). In John Doe Agency, we held that information\nneed not have been originally “compiled for law enforce\nment purposes” to satisfy Exemption 7’s threshold re\nquirement. Rather, “even though . . . documents were put\ntogether at an earlier time for a different purpose,” they\nmay fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled\nfor law enforcement purposes. 493 U. S., at 154–155. For\n\f4            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nexample, documents originally gathered for routine busi\nness purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are\nlater compiled for use in a criminal investigation. Simi\nlarly, federal building plans and related information—\nwhich may have been compiled originally for architectural\nplanning or internal purposes—may fall within Exemption\n7 if that information is later compiled and given to law\nenforcement officers for security purposes.\n  Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not nec-\nessarily deprived of Exemption 7’s protection. The text\nof Exemption 7 does not require that the information\nbe compiled solely for law enforcement purposes. Cf.\n§552(b)(2) (“related solely to the internal personnel rules\nand practices of an agency”). Therefore, it may be\nenough that law enforcement purposes are a significant\nreason for the compilation.\n  In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the\nExplosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information\nfalls within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the\nNavy argues, is used “for the purpose of identifying and\naddressing security issues” and for the “protection of\npeople and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby\ncommunity, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that\ncould occur from an accident or breach of security.” Brief\nfor Appellee in No. 07–36056 (CA9), pp. 39–40. If, indeed,\nthe ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to\nprevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security,\nthere is a reasonable argument that the information has\nbeen “compiled for law enforcement purposes.” §552(b)(7).\nAssuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the\nESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption\n7(F).\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U.

DEPARTMENT\n               OF THE NAVY\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.\n   Justice Stevens has explained that, once “a statute has\nbeen construed, either by this Court or by a consistent\ncourse of decision by other federal judges and agencies,” it\ncan acquire a clear meaning that this Court should hesi\ntate to change. See Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 268 (1987) (opinion concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). See also\nCommissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104 (1987) (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting); B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial\nProcess 149 (1921). I would apply that principle to this\ncase and accept the 30-year-old decision by the D. C. Cir\ncuit in Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,\n670 F. 2d 1051 (1981) (en banc), as properly stating the\nlaw.\n   For one thing, the Crooker decision, joined by 9 of the 10\nsitting Circuit Judges, has been consistently followed, or\nfavorably cited, by every Court of Appeals to have consid\nered the matter during the past 30 years. See ibid. (writ\nten by Judge Edwards, and joined by Chief Judge Robin\nson and Judges Wright, MacKinnon, Robb, Wald, Mikva,\nand then-Judge Ginsburg, with Judge Tamm concurring\nin the result and Judge Wilkey dissenting); Massey v. FBI,\n3 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d\n884, 889 (CA7 1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1011 (1989);\n\f2            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nDirksen v. HHS, 803 F. 2d 1456, 1458 (CA9 1986). Three\nCircuits adopted a different approach in the 1970’s before\nCrooker was decided, see ante, at 3–4, n. 2, but I read\nsubsequent decisions in two of those Circuits as not adher\ning to their early positions. See Abraham & Rose, PLC v.\nUnited States, 138 F. 3d 1075, 1080–1081 (CA6 1998)\n(finding Crooker’s textual analysis “sound and persuasive,”\nand noting that FBI symbols “used internally to identify\nconfidential sources” may be withheld); Sladek v.\nBensinger, 605 F. 2d 899, 902 (CA5 1979) (expressly re\nserving judgment on the Crooker issue). As for the re\nmaining Circuit, its district courts understand Crooker\nnow to apply. See, e.g., Gavin v. SEC, No. 04–4522, 2007\nWL 2454156, *5–*6 (D Minn., Aug. 23, 2007); see also\nMcQueen v. United States, 264 F. Supp. 2d 502, 528 (SD\nTex. 2003), aff’d, 100 Fed. Appx. 964 (CA5 2004) (per\ncuriam); Tickel v. IRS, No. 1–85–709, 1986 WL 14436, *2–\n*3 (ED Tenn., Aug. 22, 1986). I recognize that there is\nreasonable ground for disagreement over the precise\nstatus of certain pre-Crooker precedents, but the Crooker\ninterpretation of Exemption 2 has guided nearly every\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) case decided over the\nlast 30 years. See generally Dept. of Justice, Guide to\nFreedom of Information Act, pp. 184–206 (2009) (FOIA\nGuide) (identifying over 100 district court decisions apply\ning the Crooker approach, and one appearing to reject it).\n   Congress, moreover, well aware of Crooker, left Exemp\ntion 2, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(2), untouched when it amended\nthe FOIA five years later. See S. Rep. No. 98–221, p. 25\n(1983) (discussing Crooker); Freedom of Information Re\nform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207–48 (amending Exemption\n7, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)).\n   This Court has found that circumstances of this kind\noffer significant support for retaining an interpretation of\na statute that has been settled by the lower courts.

Frickey, & E. Garrett,\nCases and Materials on Legislation 1048 (4th ed. 2007)\n(“[T]he acquiescence rule can also support implicit con\ngressional ratification of a uniform line of federal appel\nlate interpretations . . .”).\n    For another thing, even if the majority’s analysis would\nhave persuaded me if written on a blank slate, Crooker’s\nanalysis was careful and its holding reasonable. The\nCircuit Court examined the statute’s language, the legisla\ntive history, and the precedent. It recognized that the\nexemption’s words (“related solely to the internal person\nnel rules and practices of an agency”) could easily be read,\nas the Court reads them today, to refer only to human\nresources rules and practices. See 670 F. 2d, at 1056–\n1057. But it also thought that those words could be read\nmore broadly as referring to internal rules or practices\nthat set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to\nfollow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the\ninformation at issue was “not of legitimate public inter\nest”). Id., at 1056, 1057.\n    The D. C. Circuit agreed with today’s Court that the\nSenate Report described the exemption as referring to\n“ ‘internal personnel’ ” matters, giving as examples “ ‘per\nsonnel’s use of parking facilities, . . . sick leave, and the\nlike.’ ” Id., at 1058–1059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th\n\f4            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCong., 1st Sess., p. 8 (1965)). But it also noted that the\nHouse Report described the exemption as protecting from\ndisclosure “ ‘[o]perating rules, guidelines, and manuals of\nprocedure for Government investigators or examiners.’ ”\n670 F. 2d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th\nCong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)). “[U]pon reflection,” it\nthought the views of the two Houses “reconcilable” if one\nunderstood both sets of examples as referring to internal\nstaff information (both minor personnel matters and staff\ninstruction matters) that the public had no legitimate\ninterest in learning about. 670 F. 2d, at 1065. And it\naccepted this view in light of its hesitation to “apply indi\nvidual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to\nCongress’ intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforce\nment efforts.” Id., at 1066. At the same time it found no\nother exemption that would protect internal documents in\nwhich there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure—\na category that includes, say, building plans, safe combi\nnations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the\nlike.\n   After examining in depth the legislative history and\nrelevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based\non a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as\nlanguage used by this Court in Department of Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U. S. 352, 369 (1976). The D. C. Circuit held\nthat a document fits within the literal language of Exemp\ntion 2 and is exempt from disclosure if (1) it “meets the\ntest of ‘predominant internality,’ ” i.e., the document is\n“not of legitimate public interest,” and (2) “disclosure\nsignificantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or\nstatutes.” Crooker, supra, at 1056, 1074; see also Rose,\nsupra, at 369 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply\nwhere “disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regu\nlation”). This test, based upon Congress’ broader FOIA\nobjectives and a “common sense” view of what information\nCongress did and did not want to make available, Crooker,\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, at 1074, takes the “practical approach” that this\nCourt has “consistently . . . taken” when interpreting the\nFOIA, John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146,\n157 (1989).\n   I would not underestimate the importance of this “prac\ntical approach.” It reflects this Court’s longstanding rec\nognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Ad\nministrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part)\nwith the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the\ntax code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law\nTreatise §7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (“Judicial interpreta\ntion of the malleable language of the APA has produced\nchanges in the rulemaking procedure that could be charac\nterized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day\nor a year rather than gradually over a period of decades”);\ncf. Sunstein & Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions,\n101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917–918, and n. 111 (2003) (observ\ning that Congress “appears to rely on courts for long peri\nods of time” to give meaning to the APA, which justifies\ninterpreting it less formalistically than statutes like “the\nInternal Revenue Code”). That in large part is because\nthe FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must\ngovern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numer\nous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, per\nforming numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too\nnarrow an interpretation, while working well in the case\nof one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional\nobjectives when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit’s\nanswer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemp\ntion 2 in light of Congress’ basic effort to achieve a\n“workable balance between the interests of the public in\ngreater access to information and the needs of the Gov\nernment to protect certain kinds of information from\ndisclosure.” John Doe Agency, supra, at 157. See also\nS. Rep. No. 1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 8, 11 (1964) (em\nphasizing this “workable” balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5\n\f6            MILNER v.

No. 1497, at 2, 6 (same).\n   Further, 30 years of experience with Crooker’s holding\nsuggests that it has not seriously interfered with the\nFOIA’s informational objectives, while at the same time it\nhas permitted agencies to withhold much information\nwhich, in my view, Congress would not have wanted to\nforce into the public realm. To focus only on the case law,\ncourts have held that that information protected by Ex\nemption 2 includes blueprints for Department of Agricul\nture buildings that store biological agents, Elliot v.

Forest Serv.,\n104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997), and Maricopa Audubon\nSoc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997)). See\ngenerally FOIA Guide 201, and n. 106 (citing nine deci\nsions applying the Crooker approach but nonetheless\nrequiring disclosure).\n   The majority acknowledges that “our decision today\nupsets three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker,\nand therefore may force considerable adjustments.” Ante,\nat 18. But how are these adjustments to be made? Should\nthe Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the\nprotection it believes necessary? As JUSTICE ALITO notes,\nExemption 7 applies where the documents consist of “re\ncords or information compiled for law enforcement pur\nposes” and release would, e.g., “disclose techniques and\nprocedures for law enforcement investigations,” or “could\nreasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical\nsafety of any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7). But what\nabout information that is not compiled for law enforce\nment purposes, such as building plans, computer pass\nwords, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations?\nThe Government, which has much experience litigating\nFOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 “targets only a\nsubset of the important agency functions that may be\ncircumvented.” Brief for Respondent 52–53. Today’s\ndecision only confirms this point, as the Court’s insistence\non narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid\nreading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide Crooker\ntype protection.\n   The majority suggests that the Government can classify\ndocuments that should remain private. Ante, at 18. See 5\nU. S. C. §552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material\n“properly classified” as authorized to be “kept secret in the\ninterest of national defense or foreign policy”). But classi\n\f8             MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfication is at best a partial solution. It takes time. It is\nsubject to its own rules. As the Government points out, it\nwould hinder the sharing of information about Govern\nment buildings with “first responders,” such as local fire\nand police departments. Brief for Respondent 53–54. And\nboth Congress and the President believe the Nation cur\nrently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified\nmaterial. See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat.\n2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, §§1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3\nCFR 298, 299–300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Con\ngress recently found:\n    “The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that\n    the over-classification of information interferes with\n    accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing,\n    increases the cost of information security, and need\n    lessly limits stakeholder and public access to informa\n    tion.\n       “Over-classification of information causes consider\n    able confusion regarding what information may be\n    shared with whom, and negatively affects the dis\n    semination of information within the Federal Gov\n    ernment and with State, local, and tribal entities, and\n    with the private sector.” Reducing Over-Classification\n    Act, §§2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.\nThese legislative findings suggest that it is “over\nclassification,” not Crooker, that poses the more serious\nthreat to the FOIA’s public information objectives.\n   That leaves congressional action. As the Court points\nout, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it\nfinds in today’s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative\naction takes time; Congress has much to do; and other\nmatters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may war\nrant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the\ncourts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Con\ngress’ public information objectives into workable agency\n\f                Cite as: 562 U.

Argued December 1, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to\n  make Government records available to the public, subject to nine ex\n  emptions.

Pp. 6–19.\n    (a) Exemption 2 shields only those records relating to “personnel\n rules and practices.” When used as an adjective in this manner, the\n key statutory word “personnel” refers to human resources matters.\n For example, a “personnel department” deals with employee prob\n lems and interviews applicants for jobs. FOIA Exemption 6 provides\n another example, protecting certain “personnel . . . files” from disclo\n sure. §552(b)(6). “[T]he common and congressional meaning of . . .\n ‘personnel file’ ” is a file maintained by a human resources office col\n lecting personal information about employees, such as examination\n results and work performance evaluations. Rose, supra, at 377. Ex\n emption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way. An agency’s “per\n sonnel rules and practices” all share a critical feature: They concern\n conditions of employment in federal agencies—such matters as hiring\n and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.\n These items currently fall within the so-called Low 2 exemption. And\n under this Court’s construction of the statutory language, Low 2 is all\n of 2.\n    FOIA’s purpose reinforces this reading. The statute’s goal is\n “broad disclosure,” and the exemptions must be “given a narrow com\n pass.” Department of Justice v.

The D. C.

Judicial\ndecisions since FOIA’s enactment have analyzed and\nreanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But compara\ntively little attention has focused on the provision’s 12\nsimple words: “related solely to the internal personnel\nrules and practices of an agency.”\n   The key word in that dozen—the one that most clearly\nmarks the provision’s boundaries—is “personnel.” When\nused as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and\npractices,” that term refers to human resources matters.\n“Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selec\ntion, placement, and training of employees and . . . the\nformulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or\ninvolving] employees or their representatives.” Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinaf\nter Webster’s). So, for example, a “personnel department”\nis “the department of a business firm that deals with\nproblems affecting the employees of the firm and that\nusually interviews applicants for jobs.” Random House\nDictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House).\n“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of man\nagement concerned with the engagement and effective\nutilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of\nhuman resources.” Webster’s 1687. And a “personnel\nagency” is “an agency for placing employable persons in\njobs; employment agency.” Random House 1075.\n   FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemp\ntion 6. See Ratzlaf v.

Here too, the statute uses the\nterm “personnel” as a modifier meaning “human re\nsources.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32 (“[The Court:] It’s [an]\nH. R. file, right? [The Government:] That’s generally\ntrue”). As we recognized in Rose, “the common and con\ngressional meaning of . . . ‘personnel file’ ” is the file “show\ning, for example, where [an employee] was born, the\nnames of his parents, where he has lived from time to\ntime, his . . . school records, results of examinations, [and]\nevaluations of his work performance.” 425 U. S., at 377.\nIt is the file typically maintained in the human resources\noffice—otherwise known (to recall an example offered\nabove) as the “personnel department.” Ibid.\n   Exemption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way.\nAn agency’s “personnel rules and practices” are its rules\nand practices dealing with employee relations or human\nresources. The D. C. Circuit, in a pre-Crooker decision,\ngave as examples “matters relating to pay, pensions,\nvacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.”\nJordan, 591 F. 2d, at 763; see supra, at 3. That “etc.” is\nimportant; we doubt any court could know enough about\nthe Federal Government’s operations to formulate a com\nprehensive list.

See Rose, 425\nU. S., at 362. We would ill-serve Congress’s purpose by\n——————\n—to the agency’s “personnel rules and practices.” And the information\nmust be “internal”; that is, the agency must typically keep the records\nto itself for its own use. See Webster’s 1180 (“internal” means “existing\nor situated within the limits . . . of something”). An agency’s human\nresources documents will often meet these conditions.\n   5 The dissent would reject this longstanding rule of construction in\n\nfavor of an approach asking courts “to turn Congress’ public informa\ntion objectives into workable agency practice.” Post, at 8–9 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). But nothing in FOIA either explicitly or implicitly grants\ncourts discretion to expand (or contract) an exemption on this basis. In\nenacting FOIA, Congress struck the balance it thought right—generally\nfavoring disclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions—\nand did so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government.\nSee, e.g., John Doe Agency v.

Brief for Respondent 41 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors\nthis reading of the statute. Post, at 1. But the Crooker\ninterpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent\nflaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2’s text. The High\n2 test (in addition to substituting the word “predomi\nnantly” for “solely,” see n. 1, supra) ignores the plain\nmeaning of the adjective “personnel,” see supra, at 6–9,\nand adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or\nreferent in Exemption 2’s language. Indeed, the only way\nto arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute—\n“cutting out some” words and “pasting in others” until\nlittle of the actual provision remains. Elliott v.

See Brief for Respondent 33–38. A statement in\nthat Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the\n\f                      Cite as: 562 U.

According to the Report: “Operating rules,\nguidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government\ninvestigators or examiners would be exempt from disclo\nsure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption would not\ncover . . . employee relations and working conditions and\nroutine administrative procedures.” H. R. Rep. No. 1497,\n89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). But the Senate Report\nsays exactly the opposite, explaining in support of a Low 2\ninterpretation that the phrase “internal personnel rules\nand practices of an agency” means “rules as to personnel’s\nuse of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,\nstatements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”\nS. Rep., at 8.6 In Rose, we gave reasons for thinking the\nSenate Report the more reliable of the two. See 425 U. S.,\nat 366. But the more fundamental point is what we said\nbefore: Legislative history, for those who take it into ac\ncount, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it. See\nsupra, at 9; Wong Yang Sung v.

Congress, the Government notes, amended\nExemption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records\nwhose production “would disclose techniques and proce\ndures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,\n\n——————\n  6 We are perplexed that the dissent takes seriously Crooker’s notion\n\nthat the reports are “reconcilable.” Post, at 4. To strip the matter to its\nessentials, the House Report says: “Exemption 2 means A, but not B.”\nThe Senate Report says: “Exemption 2 means B.” That is the very\ndefinition of “irreconcilable.”\n\f12           MILNER v.

That amendment, the Government con\ntends, codified Crooker’s “circumvention of the law” stan\ndard and, in so doing, ratified Crooker’s holding. Brief for\nRespondent 42–43. The dissent likewise counts as signifi\ncant that Congress “t[ook] note” of Crooker in revising\nFOIA. Post, at 9; see post, at 2.\n   But the Government and the dissent neglect the key\nfeature of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not\nExemption 2 (the subject of Crooker), but instead Exemp\ntion 7(E). And the Crooker construction of Exemption 2\nrenders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that\namendment of any effect. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118465\"><a href=\"/opinion/118465/trw-inc-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should\nbe read to avoid making any provision “superfluous, void,\nor insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ncannot think of any document eligible for withholding\nunder Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not\ncapture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the\nlaw enforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are\n“predominantly internal.” So if Congress had agreed with\nCrooker’s reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no\nreason to alter Exemption 7(E). In that event, Congress\nwould either have left the statute alone (on the theory that\nCrooker would do the necessary work) or would have\namended Exemption 2 specifically to ratify Crooker. The\ndecision instead to amend Exemption 7(E) suggests that\nCongress approved the circumvention standard only as to\nlaw enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of\nrecords High 2 covers. Perhaps this legislative action does\nnot show that Congress affirmatively disagreed with\nCrooker; maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the\ncircumvention standard should apply to other records.\nBut one thing is clear: The 1986 amendment does not\n\f                     Cite as: 562 U.

This argument\ntherefore cannot save the High 2 construction.\n  The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2,\nand indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.\nCrooker, the dissent asserts, “has been consistently relied\nupon and followed for 30 years” by other lower courts.\nPost, at 9; see post, at 1–2. But this claim, too, trips at the\nstarting gate. It would be immaterial even if true, because\nwe have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on\nthe ground that other courts have done so. And in any\nevent, it is not true. Prior to Crooker, three Circuits\nadopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and\nthey have not changed their minds. See n. 2, supra.7\n——————\n  7 The  dissent’s view that “two of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed]\nto their early positions” is incorrect. Post, at 2. In Abraham & Rose,\nP.L.C. v.

Its only\nreference to Crooker concerned the part of that decision interpreting\n“solely” to mean “predominantly.” See 138 F.3d, at 1080; see also n. 1,\nsupra. Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in Rugiero v.\nDepartment of Justice, that Exemption 2 applies to “routine matters of\nmerely internal significance.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774052\"><a href=\"/opinion/774052/patrick-rugiero-v-united-states-department-of-justice-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (2001). In Sladek v.\nBensinger, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that\nthe Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s\nmanual because it “is not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of\nparking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369701\"><a href=\"/opinion/369701/dennis-j-sladek-v-peter-bensinger-in-his-capacity-as-administrator/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 902\n(1979). In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court\nacknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.\nThe court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation\nbecause it would not have changed the case’s outcome. See ibid.\nFinally, the Eighth Circuit’s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the\ndissent does not say otherwise. The exemption, according to that most\nrecent Eighth Circuit decision, applies “only [to an agency’s] housekeep\ning matters.” Cox, 576 F. 2d, at 1309–1310 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).

DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSince Crooker, three other Circuits have accepted the High\n2 reading. See supra, at 3. One Circuit has reserved\njudgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. See Audubon\nSociety v.

And the rest have not considered the matter. (No\none should think Crooker has been extensively discussed\nor debated in the Courts of Appeals. In the past three\ndecades, Crooker’s analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited\na sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions\noutside the D. C. Circuit—on average, once every six\nyears.) The result is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.8\nWe will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation\nto take the side of the bare majority.\n                              B\n   Presumably because Crooker so departs from Exemption\n2’s language, the Government also offers another con\nstruction, which it says we might adopt “on a clean slate,”\n“based on the plain text . . . alone.” Brief for Respondent\n15. On this reading, the exemption “encompasses records\nconcerning an agency’s internal rules and practices for its\npersonnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental\nfunctions.” Id., at 20; see also id., at 13–14 (Exemption 2\n“applies generally to matters concerning internal rules\nand practices to guide agency personnel in performing\n——————\nCircuits applying Crooker; but that statement does not hold in the\nCircuits using the Low 2 approach.\n   8 Notably, even those courts approving Crooker have disagreed about\n\nhow to apply High 2.

Fletcher, J., dissenting). The disagreement is not\nsurprising. Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts\nlack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage.\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir duties”). According to the Government, this inter\npretation makes sense because “the phrase ‘personnel\nrules and practices of an agency’ is logically understood to\nmean an agency’s rules and practices for its personnel.”\nId., at 20 (emphasis added).\n   But the purported logic in the Government’s definition\neludes us. We would not say, in ordinary parlance, that a\n“personnel file” is any file an employee uses, or that a\n“personnel department” is any department in which an\nemployee serves. No more would we say that a “personnel\nrule or practice” is any rule or practice that assists an\nemployee in doing her job. The use of the term “personnel”\nin each of these phrases connotes not that the file or de\npartment or practice/rule is for personnel, but rather that\nthe file or department or practice/rule is about personnel—\ni.e., that it relates to employee relations or human re\nsources. This case well illustrates the point. The records\nrequested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps\nshowing the distances that potential blasts travel. This\ninformation no doubt assists Navy personnel in storing\nmunitions. But that is not to say that the data and maps\nrelate to “personnel rules and practices.” No one staring\nat these charts of explosions and using ordinary language\nwould describe them in this manner.\n   Indeed, the Government’s “clean slate” construction\nreaches such documents only by stripping the word “per\nsonnel” of any real meaning. Under this interpretation,\nan agency’s “internal personnel rules and practices” ap\npears to mean all its internal rules and practices. That is\nbecause agencies necessarily operate through personnel,\nand so all their internal rules and practices are for per\nsonnel. The modifier “personnel,” then, does no modifying\nwork; it does not limit the class of internal rules and\npractices that Exemption 2 covers. What is most naturally\nviewed as the provision’s key word—the term that ought\n\f16              MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto define its scope—does nothing more than state the\ntruism that in an agency it is “personnel” who follow\ninternal rules and practices.\n   And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemp\ntion, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a dis\nclosure than “a withholding statute.” Mink, 410 U. S., at\n79. Many documents an agency generates in some way\naid employees in carrying out their responsibilities. If\nExemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend\nto engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the\nlimitations Congress placed on their application. Exemp\ntion 7, for example, shields records compiled for law en\nforcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria\nis met. §552(b)(7). Yet on the Government’s view, an\nagency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemp\ntion 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel\nin performing their duties. Indeed, an agency could use\nExemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to with\nhold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA’s\nmore targeted exemptions.9\n——————\n  9 The dissent asserts that “30 years of experience” with a more expan\nsive interpretation of the exemption suggests no “seriou[s] inter\nfere[nce] with . . . FOIA’s informational objectives.” Post, at 6. But\nthose objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based\non an improper interpretation of the statute. To give just one example,\nthe U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple\noccasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting\nsites. See Audubon Society v.

And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies\nmay too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure.

S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). We doubt\nthat even the “internal management” provision, which\nCongress thought allowed too much withholding, see\nsupra, at 2, would have protected all information that\nguides employees in the discharge of their duties, includ\ning the explosives data and maps in this case. And per\nhaps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates\nthe rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions.\nSee, e.g., Abramson, 456 U. S., at 630; Rose, 425 U. S., at\n361. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or\npurpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.\n                              V\n   Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Gov\nernment proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy’s\ninterest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other\nsimilar information. The Government has informed us\nthat “[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would\nsignificantly risk undermining the Navy’s ability to safely\nand securely store military ordnance,” Brief for Respon\ndent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representa\ntion. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclo\nsure of this information could be used to “wrea[k] havoc”\nand “make catastrophe more likely.” 575 F. 3d, at 971.\nConcerns of this kind—a sense that certain sensitive\ninformation should be exempt from disclosure—in part led\nthe Crooker court to formulate the High 2 standard.

DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nness of law enforcement agencies”). And we acknowledge\nthat our decision today upsets three decades of agency\npractice relying on Crooker, and therefore may force con\nsiderable adjustments.\n   We also note, however, that the Government has other\ntools at hand to shield national security information and\nother sensitive materials. Most notably, Exemption 1 of\nFOIA prevents access to classified documents. §552(b)(1);\nsee 575 F. 3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemp\ntion 1 is “specifically designed to allow government agen\ncies to withhold information that might jeopardize our\nnational security”). The Government generally may clas\nsify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see\nExec. Order No. 13526, §1.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009);\nan agency therefore may wait until that time to decide\nwhether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of\nclassification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. Exemption 3\nalso may mitigate the Government’s security concerns.\nThat provision applies to records that any other statute\nexempts from disclosure, §552(b)(3), thus offering Con\ngress an established, streamlined method to authorize the\nwithholding of specific records that FOIA would not oth\nerwise protect. And Exemption 7, as already noted, pro\ntects “information compiled for law enforcement purposes”\nthat meets one of six criteria, including if its release “could\nreasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical\nsafety of any individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). The Navy argued\nbelow that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemp\ntion 7(F), see n. 3, supra, and that claim remains open for\nthe Ninth Circuit to address on remand.\n   If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose\nrelease would threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the\nGovernment may of course seek relief from Congress. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold today is that Congress has\nnot enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.\n\f                  Cite as: 562 U.

As the Court explains, however,\nthe Government may avail itself of numerous other ex\nemptions, see ante, at 18—exemptions that may have been\novershadowed in recent years by the broad reach of High\n2. I write separately to underscore the alternative argu\nment that the Navy raised below, which rested on Exemp\ntion 7(F) and which will remain open on remand. See\nante, at 5, n. 3, 18.\n   Exemption 7 applies to specific categories of information\n“compiled for law enforcement purposes.” 5 U. S. C.\n§552(b)(7). In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits with\nholding of “records or information compiled for law en\nforcement purposes” that, if disclosed, “could reasonably\nbe expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any\nindividual.” §552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving secu\nrity information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure\nmay “endanger the life or physical safety of any individ\nual.” A more difficult question, however, is whether the\ninformation is “compiled for law enforcement purposes.”\nSee John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112344\"><a href=\"/opinion/112344/john-doe-agency-v-john-doe-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153\n(1989) (“Before it may invoke [Exemption 7], the Govern\n\f2             MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nment has the burden of proving the existence of . . . a\ncompilation for such a purpose”). In my view, this phrase\nreasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official\nsecurity and crime prevention duties.\n   “Law enforcement purposes.” The ordinary understand\ning of law enforcement includes not just the investigation\nand prosecution of offenses that have already been com\nmitted, but also proactive steps designed to prevent crimi\nnal activity and to maintain security. A “law enforcement\nofficer” is defined as one “whose duty it is to preserve the\npeace,” Black’s Law Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and\nfulfilling that duty involves a range of activities. Police on\nthe beat aim to prevent crime from occurring, and they no\nless carry out “law enforcement purposes” than officers\ninvestigating a crime scene. Similarly, a “law-enforcement\nagency” is charged with “the apprehension of alleged\noffenders as well as crime detection and prevention.” R. De\nSola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).\n   Crime prevention and security measures are critical to\neffective law enforcement as we know it. There can be no\ndoubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a\nlaw enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials\nfrom attack, even though no investigation may be ongoing.\nLikewise, steps by law enforcement officers to prevent\nterrorism surely fulfill “law enforcement purposes.” Par\nticularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and na\ntional security measures have been recognized as vital to\neffective law enforcement efforts in our Nation. Indeed,\n“[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,” the\npriorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation “shifted\ndramatically,” and the FBI’s “top priority became the\nprevention of another terrorist attack.” Hearings before\nthe Subcommittee on Science, the Departments of State,\nJustice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies of the\nHouse Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., pt. 10, 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nS. Mueller III). Today, “[t]he FBI’s number one priority\ncontinues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against\nthe United States.” Hearings before the Senate Commit\ntee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,\n111th Cong., 2d Sess, p. ___ (Sept. 22, 2010) (testimony of\nMueller). If crime prevention and security measures do\nnot serve “law enforcement purposes,” then those charged\nwith law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of\nfulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.\n  The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read natu\nrally, “law enforcement purposes” involve more than just\ninvestigation and prosecution. As Exemption 7’s subpara\ngraphs demonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these\nnarrower activities. See, e.g., §552(b)(7)(A) (information\nthat “could reasonably be expected to interfere with en\nforcement proceedings”); §552(b)(7)(E) (information that\n“would disclose techniques and procedures for law en\nforcement investigations or prosecutions”).       Congress’\ndecision to use different language to trigger Exemption 7\nconfirms that the concept of “law enforcement purposes”\nsweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution.\nSee Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137006\"><a href=\"/opinion/137006/sosa-v-alvarez-machain/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711, n. 9\n(2004) (applying the “usual rule” that “ when the legis\nlature uses certain language in one part of the statute\nand different language in another, the court assumes dif-\nferent meanings were intended” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  “Compiled for law enforcement purposes.” This Court\nhas given a fairly broad meaning to “compiled” under\n§552(b)(7). In John Doe Agency, we held that information\nneed not have been originally “compiled for law enforce\nment purposes” to satisfy Exemption 7’s threshold re\nquirement. Rather, “even though . . . documents were put\ntogether at an earlier time for a different purpose,” they\nmay fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled\nfor law enforcement purposes. 493 U. S., at 154–155. For\n\f4            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nexample, documents originally gathered for routine busi\nness purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are\nlater compiled for use in a criminal investigation. Simi\nlarly, federal building plans and related information—\nwhich may have been compiled originally for architectural\nplanning or internal purposes—may fall within Exemption\n7 if that information is later compiled and given to law\nenforcement officers for security purposes.\n  Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not nec-\nessarily deprived of Exemption 7’s protection. The text\nof Exemption 7 does not require that the information\nbe compiled solely for law enforcement purposes. Cf.\n§552(b)(2) (“related solely to the internal personnel rules\nand practices of an agency”). Therefore, it may be\nenough that law enforcement purposes are a significant\nreason for the compilation.\n  In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the\nExplosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information\nfalls within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the\nNavy argues, is used “for the purpose of identifying and\naddressing security issues” and for the “protection of\npeople and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby\ncommunity, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that\ncould occur from an accident or breach of security.” Brief\nfor Appellee in No. 07–36056 (CA9), pp. 39–40. If, indeed,\nthe ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to\nprevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security,\nthere is a reasonable argument that the information has\nbeen “compiled for law enforcement purposes.” §552(b)(7).\nAssuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the\nESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption\n7(F).\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U.

The\nCircuit Court examined the statute’s language, the legisla\ntive history, and the precedent. It recognized that the\nexemption’s words (“related solely to the internal person\nnel rules and practices of an agency”) could easily be read,\nas the Court reads them today, to refer only to human\nresources rules and practices. See 670 F. 2d, at 1056–\n1057. But it also thought that those words could be read\nmore broadly as referring to internal rules or practices\nthat set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to\nfollow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the\ninformation at issue was “not of legitimate public inter\nest”). Id., at 1056, 1057.\n    The D. C. Circuit agreed with today’s Court that the\nSenate Report described the exemption as referring to\n“ ‘internal personnel’ ” matters, giving as examples “ ‘per\nsonnel’s use of parking facilities, . . . sick leave, and the\nlike.’ ” Id., at 1058–1059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th\n\f4            MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCong., 1st Sess., p. 8 (1965)). But it also noted that the\nHouse Report described the exemption as protecting from\ndisclosure “ ‘[o]perating rules, guidelines, and manuals of\nprocedure for Government investigators or examiners.’ ”\n670 F. 2d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th\nCong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)). “[U]pon reflection,” it\nthought the views of the two Houses “reconcilable” if one\nunderstood both sets of examples as referring to internal\nstaff information (both minor personnel matters and staff\ninstruction matters) that the public had no legitimate\ninterest in learning about. 670 F. 2d, at 1065. And it\naccepted this view in light of its hesitation to “apply indi\nvidual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to\nCongress’ intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforce\nment efforts.” Id., at 1066. At the same time it found no\nother exemption that would protect internal documents in\nwhich there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure—\na category that includes, say, building plans, safe combi\nnations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the\nlike.\n   After examining in depth the legislative history and\nrelevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based\non a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as\nlanguage used by this Court in Department of Air Force v.\nRose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109431\"><a href=\"/opinion/109431/department-of-air-force-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (1976).

Circuit held\nthat a document fits within the literal language of Exemp\ntion 2 and is exempt from disclosure if (1) it “meets the\ntest of ‘predominant internality,’ ” i.e., the document is\n“not of legitimate public interest,” and (2) “disclosure\nsignificantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or\nstatutes.” Crooker, supra, at 1056, 1074; see also Rose,\nsupra, at 369 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply\nwhere “disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regu\nlation”). This test, based upon Congress’ broader FOIA\nobjectives and a “common sense” view of what information\nCongress did and did not want to make available, Crooker,\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U.

John Doe Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112344\"><a href=\"/opinion/112344/john-doe-agency-v-john-doe-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n157 (1989).\n   I would not underestimate the importance of this “prac\ntical approach.” It reflects this Court’s longstanding rec\nognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Ad\nministrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part)\nwith the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the\ntax code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law\nTreatise §7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (“Judicial interpreta\ntion of the malleable language of the APA has produced\nchanges in the rulemaking procedure that could be charac\nterized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day\nor a year rather than gradually over a period of decades”);\ncf. Sunstein & Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions,\n101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917–918, and n. 111 (2003) (observ\ning that Congress “appears to rely on courts for long peri\nods of time” to give meaning to the APA, which justifies\ninterpreting it less formalistically than statutes like “the\nInternal Revenue Code”). That in large part is because\nthe FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must\ngovern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numer\nous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, per\nforming numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too\nnarrow an interpretation, while working well in the case\nof one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional\nobjectives when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit’s\nanswer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemp\ntion 2 in light of Congress’ basic effort to achieve a\n“workable balance between the interests of the public in\ngreater access to information and the needs of the Gov\nernment to protect certain kinds of information from\ndisclosure.” John Doe Agency, supra, at 157. See also\nS. Rep. No. 1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 8, 11 (1964) (em\nphasizing this “workable” balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5\n\f6            MILNER v.

See\ngenerally FOIA Guide 201, and n. 106 (citing nine deci\nsions applying the Crooker approach but nonetheless\nrequiring disclosure).\n   The majority acknowledges that “our decision today\nupsets three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker,\nand therefore may force considerable adjustments.” Ante,\nat 18. But how are these adjustments to be made? Should\nthe Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the\nprotection it believes necessary? As JUSTICE ALITO notes,\nExemption 7 applies where the documents consist of “re\ncords or information compiled for law enforcement pur\nposes” and release would, e.g., “disclose techniques and\nprocedures for law enforcement investigations,” or “could\nreasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical\nsafety of any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7). But what\nabout information that is not compiled for law enforce\nment purposes, such as building plans, computer pass\nwords, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations?\nThe Government, which has much experience litigating\nFOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 “targets only a\nsubset of the important agency functions that may be\ncircumvented.” Brief for Respondent 52–53. Today’s\ndecision only confirms this point, as the Court’s insistence\non narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid\nreading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide Crooker\ntype protection.\n   The majority suggests that the Government can classify\ndocuments that should remain private. Ante, at 18. See 5\nU. S. C. §552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material\n“properly classified” as authorized to be “kept secret in the\ninterest of national defense or foreign policy”). But classi\n\f8             MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfication is at best a partial solution. It takes time. It is\nsubject to its own rules. As the Government points out, it\nwould hinder the sharing of information about Govern\nment buildings with “first responders,” such as local fire\nand police departments. Brief for Respondent 53–54. And\nboth Congress and the President believe the Nation cur\nrently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified\nmaterial. See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat.\n2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, §§1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3\nCFR 298, 299–300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Con\ngress recently found:\n    “The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that\n    the over-classification of information interferes with\n    accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing,\n    increases the cost of information security, and need\n    lessly limits stakeholder and public access to informa\n    tion.\n       “Over-classification of information causes consider\n    able confusion regarding what information may be\n    shared with whom, and negatively affects the dis\n    semination of information within the Federal Gov\n    ernment and with State, local, and tribal entities, and\n    with the private sector.” Reducing Over-Classification\n    Act, §§2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.\nThese legislative findings suggest that it is “over\nclassification,” not Crooker, that poses the more serious\nthreat to the FOIA’s public information objectives.\n   That leaves congressional action. As the Court points\nout, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it\nfinds in today’s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative\naction takes time; Congress has much to do; and other\nmatters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may war\nrant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the\ncourts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Con\ngress’ public information objectives into workable agency\n\f                Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          9\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npractice, and to adhere to such interpretations once they\nare settled.\n  That is why: Where the courts have already interpreted\nExemption 2, where that interpretation has been consis\ntently relied upon and followed for 30 years, where Con\ngress has taken note of that interpretation in amending\nother parts of the statute, where that interpretation is\nreasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and\nachieved commonsense results, where it is consistent with\nthe FOIA’s overall statutory goals, where a new and dif\nferent interpretation raises serious problems of its own,\nand where that new interpretation would require Con\ngress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo,\nI would let sleeping legal dogs lie.\n  For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n\f</pre>",
