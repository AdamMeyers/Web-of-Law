Ethiopia said Tuesday that it has no other motives than the return of its territories taken by Eritrea .
Ethiopia is always committed to peace and not interested in prolonging the war with Eritrea , the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
`` What it ( Eritrea ) must do is vacate every inch of Ethiopian land ... This has always been Ethiopia 's bottom line , '' the statement said .
There is no immediate response from the Eritrean side to Ethiopia 's assertion .
Ethiopia , which has been at war with Eritrea since May 1998 , has been accusing the neighboring country of having no sincerity over peace settlement over the border conflict .
