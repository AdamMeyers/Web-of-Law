'''
This module contains all of the major functionality for the IterableQueue, 
including the IterableQueue class itself.  Users should create an IterableQueue
instance, and obtain producer and consumer endpoints from it by calling
IterableQueue.get_producer() and IterableQueue.get_consumer().  These yield 
instances of ProducerQueue and ConsumerQueue endpoints, respectively, which wrap 
an underlying multiprocessing.Queue.

The ProducerQueue and ConsumerQueue endpoints expose the methods of 
multiprocessing.Queue, except that the ProducerQueue cannot .get() and the 
ConsumerQueue cannot .put().
'''

# When a new IterableQueue instance is made, it spawns a manager_process
# which is in charge of keeping track of how many producer and consumer
# endpoints are still active.  This makes it possible to know when the queue
# is truly done, which means that it isn't just empty, but the producers are
# also finished adding to it.
#
# The IterableQueue wraps an underlying multiprocessing.Queue, called the
# "work_queue", which holds the items put by the producers and consumed
# by the consumers.
#
# The IterableQueue also owns a "manage_queue" that is used to keep track of how 
# many producers and consumers are still active, and to keep processes
# syncronized during initialization and teardown.  The manage_queue is used to
# signal between the main process, the manager, and the queue endpoints (which
# are typically each living in their own process).
#
# During the lifetime of the IterableQueue, the manager goes through three 
# states:
#
#    - OPEN: While the manager process is in the OPEN state, the IterableQueue
#        is able to create new producer and consumer endpoints.  So long as
#        the state remains OPEN, we can never consider the work_queue to be
#        DONE, because active producer endpoints may add more work.  In fact,
#        new producer endpoints may be added to the queue.
#
#    - CLOSED: Once the manager is CLOSED, no new endpoints can be added,
#        although there may still be many active producer and comsumer
#        endpoints.  While in this state, the manager_process waits for the
#        number of active producers to drop to zero.  At that point, nothing new
#        can be added to the work_queue.
#
#    - CLOSED and num_producers == 0:
#        Once the number of producers reaches zero, the manager process places
#        special close signals onto the work_queue, which instruct consumer
#        queues queues to raise DONE.  If consumer queues are being treated as
#        an iterable it will cause them to StopIteration.  When a ConsumerQueue
#        receives the close signal, it sends back a confirmation to the
#        manager_process confirming that it has closed.
#
#        Meanwhile, the manager waits until all consumers have closed before
#        exiting
#
#    - CLOSED and num_consumers == 0:
#        Once the number of active consumers drops to zero, the manager exits
#
# The manage_queue provides a side-channel for signalling without having the
# signals get mixed in with the application's queue submissions.  However,
# some signalling must be sent over the work_queue to ensure proper
# synchronization.
#
# For example, when a ProducerQueue closes, it should not signal directly
# To the manager over the manage_queue.  If it did that, then it's possible
# that the manager_process would get the signal before the producer's most
# recent put() had flushed.  The manager could in turn place send a close
# signal to the consumers before the last item had been put on the work_queue.
# For this reason, both the work_queue and the manager_queue are used
# for signalling, depending on whether the signal should be synchronized with
# the work_queue or not.
#
# The flow of signalling works as follows:
# While the manager_process is open, the main process (the one in which the
# IterableQueue instance was created), sends signals on the manage_queue
# telling the manager_process when new endpoints are created or destroyed.
# At some point, in the main process, IterableQueue.close() is called,
# and the main process then sends a signal on the manage_queue to the
# manager_process indicating that no new endpoints will be created.
#
# When ProducerQueue.close() is called on producer endpoints, they don't
# signal over teh manage_queue, since we need to guarantee the manager
# recievs this signal after that producer's put() on the work_queue have
# flushed.  Thereofre the producer endpoints send close signals over the 
# work_queue.
#
# Consumers watch for the producer endpoints' close signals on the work_queue
# and simply forward them to the manager over the manage queue.  This is done
# transparently so that those signals are never actually yielded to the caller
# of the consumer queue's get().
#
# Once the manager has seen enough close signals forwarded to it from consumers
# (such that it knows there are no active producers), it sends close signals
# out to the consumers over the work_queue.  These signals are guaranteed to be
# the last signals in the work_queue, because they are placed onto the
# work_queue queue after the last item from the last producer has been
# retrieved from the work_queue. The manager sends out as many signals as there
# are consumers.  and each consumer closes in response to seeing one of these
# signals.
#
# The manager stays open during this time.  Right before closing, the consumers
# send back a confirmation to the manager tha they have closed (this matters
# because if each working item takes a long time to process, they may not
# consume the close signals right away, and if the manage process closes right
# after placing the close signals on the queue, it could corrupt the queue.
# Only after seeing a confirmation from each consumer that it has closed, sent 
# over the manage_queue, does the manager finally exit.
